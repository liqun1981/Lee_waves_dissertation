abstract = {AbstractThe abyssal ocean is primarily filled by cold, dense waters formed around Antarctica and collectively referred to as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). At steady state, AABW must be consumed in the ocean interior at the same rate it is produced, but how and where this consumption is achieved remains poorly understood. Here, we present estimates of abyssal water mass transformation by geothermal heating and parameterized internal wave-driven mixing. We use maps of the energy input to internal waves by tidal and geostrophic motions interacting with topography combined with assumptions about the distribution of energy dissipation to evaluate dianeutral transports induced by breaking internal tides and lee waves. Geothermal transformation is assessed based on a map of geothermal heat fluxes. Under the hypotheses underlying the constructed climatologies of buoyancy fluxes, we calculate that locally-dissipating internal tides and geothermal heating contribute respectively about 8 and 5 Sv of AABW consumptio...},

abstract = {Many major oceanographic internal wave observational programs of the last 4 decades are reanalyzed in order to characterize variability of the deep ocean internal wavefield. The observations are discussed in the context of the universal spectral model proposed by C. J. R. Garrett and W. H. Munk. The Garrett and Munk model is a good description of wintertime conditions at Site D on the continental rise north of the Gulf Stream. Elsewhere and at other times, significant deviations in terms of amplitude, separability of the 2-D vertical wavenumber-frequency spectrum, and departure from the model's functional form are reported. Specifically, the Garrett and Munk model overestimates annual average frequency domain spectral levels both at Site D and in general. The bias at Site D is associated with the Garrett and Munk model being a fit to wintertime data from Site D and the presence of an annual cycle in high-frequency energy in the western subtropical North Atlantic having a maximum in winter. The wave spectrum is generally nonseparable, with near-inertial waves typically having greater bandwidth (occupying smaller vertical scales) than continuum frequency waves. Separability is a better approximation for more energetic states, such as wintertime conditions at Site D. Subtle geographic differences from the high-frequency and high vertical wavenumber power laws of the Garrett and Munk spectrum are apparent. Such deviations tend to covary: whiter frequency spectra are partnered with redder vertical wavenumber spectra. We review a general theoretical framework of statistical radiative balance equations and interpret the observed variability in terms of the interplay between generation, propagation, and nonlinearity. First, nonlinearity is a fundamental organizing principle in this work. The observed power laws lie close to the induced diffusion stationary states of the resonant kinetic equation describing the lowest-order nonlinear transfers. Second, eddy variability and by implication wave mean interactions are also an organizing principle. Observations from regions of low eddy variability tend to be outliers in terms of their parametric spectral representation; other data tend to cluster in two regions of parameter space. More tentatively, the seasonal cycle of high-frequency energy is in phase with the near-inertial seasonal cycle in regions of significant eddy variability. In regions of low eddy variability, the seasonal cycle in high-frequency energy lags that of near-inertial energy. The induced diffusion stationary states are approximate analytic solutions to the resonant kinetic equation, and the Garrett and Munk spectrum represents one such analytic solution. We present numerical solutions of the resonant kinetic equation, however, that are inconsistent with the Garrett and Munk model representing a stationary state, either alone or in combination with other physical mechanisms. We believe this to be the case for other regional characterizations as well. We argue that nonstationarity of the numerical solutions is related to local transfers in horizontal wavenumber, whereas the analytic induced diffusion stationary states consider only nonlocal transfers in vertical wavenumber. Consequences for understanding the pathways by which energy is transferred from sources to sinks are considered. Further progress likely requires self-consistent solutions to a broadened kinetic equation.},

abstract = {AbstractDespite the major role played by mesoscale eddies in redistributing the energy of the large-scale circulation, our understanding of their dissipation is still incomplete. This study investigates the generation of internal waves by decaying eddies in the North Atlantic western boundary. The eddy presence and decay are measured from the altimetric surface relative vorticity associated with an array of full-depth current meters extending $\sim$100 km offshore at 26.5°N. In addition, internal waves are analyzed over a topographic rise from 2-yr high-frequency measurements of an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), which is located 13 km offshore in 600-m deep water. Despite an apparent polarity independence of the eddy decay observed from altimetric data, the flow in the deepest 100 m is enhanced for anticyclones (25.2 cm s−1) compared with cyclones (−4.7 cm s−1). Accordingly, the internal wave field is sensitive to this polarity-dependent deep velocity. This is apparent from the eddy-modulated enhanc...},

abstract = {The Thorpe scale is an energy containing vertical overturning scale of large eddies associated with shear generated turbulence. We make here indirect estimates of vertical diffusivities from the Thorpe scale method in the Polar Front region east of the Kerguelen Islands based on fine scale density profiles gathered during the 2011 KEOPS2 cruise. These are validated in comparison with diffusivities estimated from the turbulence dissipation rate directly measured via a TurboMAP microprofiler. The results are sensitive to the choice of the diffusivity parameterization and the Gargett and Garner's (2008) overturn ratio Ro, with the optimal results showing an agreement within a factor of 4, on average, having been obtained from the parameterization by Shih et al. (2005) and the Ro = 0.25 criterion. The Thorpe scale-derived diffusivities in the KEOPS2 region show a high degree of spatial variability, ranging from a canonical value of O(10−5 m2 s−1) in the Winter Water layer and in the Subantarctic surface waters immediately north of the Polar Front to a high value of O(10−4 m2 s−1) in the seasonal thermocline just below the surface mixed layer. The latter values are found especially over the shallow plateau southeast of the Kerguelen Islands and in the Antarctic surface waters associated with the Polar Front attached to the escarpment northeast of the islands.},

abstract = {The impact of small-scale topography on the ocean's dynamical balance is investigated by quantifying the rates at which internal wave drag extracts (angular) momentum and vorticity from the general circulation. The calculation exploits the recent advent of two near-global descriptions of topographic roughness on horizontal scales on the order of 1–10 km, which play a central role in the generation of internal lee waves by geostrophic flows impinging on topography and have been hitherto unresolved by bathymetric datasets and ocean general circulation models alike. It is found that, while internal wave drag is a minor contributor to the ocean's dynamical balance over much of the globe, it is a significant player in the dynamics of extensive areas of the ocean, most notably the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and several regions of enhanced small-scale topographic variance in the equatorial and Southern Hemisphere oceans. There, the contribution of internal wave drag to the ocean's (angular) momentum and vorticity balances is generally on the order of ten to a few tens of percent of the dominant source and sink terms in each dynamical budget, which are respectively associated with wind forcing and form drag by topography with horizontal scales from 500 to 1000 km. It is thus suggested that the representation of internal wave drag in general circulation models may lead to sig-nificant changes in the deep ocean circulation of those regions. A theoretical scaling is derived that captures the basic dependence of internal wave drag on topographic roughness and near-bottom flow speed for most oceanographically relevant regimes.},

abstract = {A simple model of the CaCO3 saturation state of the ocean is presented. It can be solved analytically and is intended to identify the fundamental controls on ocean carbonate ion concentration. It should also attract researchers unfamiliar with complex biogeochemical models. Despite its limitations, the model-calculated CaCO3 saturation state of today's ocean agrees well with observations. In general, the model reveals three distinctly different modes of operation: The "Strangelove Ocean'' of high supersaturation which is dominated by inorganic CaCO3 precipitation, (2) the "Neritan Ocean'' of indefinite saturation dominated by biogenic shallow-water CaCO3 precipitation, and (3) the "Cretan Ocean'' of low saturation dominated by biogenic pelagic CaCO3 precipitation. In the latter mode, the deep ocean CO32- is remarkably stable, provided that the biogenic production of CaCO3 exceeds the riverine flux of Ca2+ and CO32-. This explains the overall constancy of the saturation state of the ocean documented over the last 100 Ma. The model is then used to address diverse questions. One important result is that the recovery of the oceanic carbonate chemistry from fossil fuel neutralization in the future will be accelerated due to expected reduced biogenic calcification.},

The warmest waters to reach this region are channeled through a submarine trough, accessed via bathymetric irregularities along the shelf break. Temporal variability in the influx of CDW is related to regional wind forcing. Easterly winds over the shelf edge change to westerlies when the Amundsen Sea Low migrates west and south in winter/spring. This drives seasonal on-shelf flow, while inter-annual changes in the wind forcing lead to inflow variability on a decadal timescale. A modelled period of warming following low CDW influx in the late 1980's and early 1990's coincides with a period of observed thinning and acceleration of Pine Island Glacier.},

Seven submarine deposits have sources on the flanks of Montserrat, while three are related to the nearby Kahouanne submarine volcanoes. The most voluminous deposit (20 km3) within the Bouillante-Montserrat half-graben has not been described previously and is probably related to a flank instability of the Centre Hills Volcano on Montserrat, while other events are related to the younger South Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills-Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcanic complex. All deposits are located to the south or southeast of the island in an area delimited by faults of the Bouillante-Montserrat half-graben. They cover a large part of the southeast quarter of the surrounding seafloor (520 km2), with a total volume of 40 km3. Our observations suggest that the Bouillante-Montserrat half-graben exerts a control on the extent and propagation of the most voluminous deposits. We propose an interpretation for mass-wasting processes around Montserrat similar to what has happened for the southern islands of the Lesser Antilles.},

abstract = {We examine the annular mode within each hemisphere (defined here as the leading empirical orthogonal function and principal component of hemispheric sea level pressure) as simulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report ensembles of coupled ocean-atmosphere models. The simulated annular patterns exhibit a high spatial correlation with the observed patterns during the late 20th century, though the mode represents too large a percentage of total temporal variability within each hemisphere. In response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulfate aerosols, the multimodel average exhibits a positive annular trend in both hemispheres, with decreasing sea level pressure (SLP) over the pole and a compensating increase in midlatitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the trend agrees in sign but is of smaller amplitude than that observed during recent decades. In the Southern Hemisphere, decreasing stratospheric ozone causes an additional reduction in Antarctic surface pressure during the latter half of the 20th century. While annular trends in the multimodel average are positive, individual model trends vary widely. Not all models predict a decrease in high-latitude SLP, although no model exhibits an increase. As a test of the models' annular sensitivity, the response to volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere is calculated during the winter following five major tropical eruptions. The observed response exhibits coupling between stratospheric anomalies and annular variations at the surface, similar to the coupling between these levels simulated elsewhere by models in response to increasing GHG concentration. The multimodel average is of the correct sign but significantly smaller in magnitude than the observed annular anomaly. This suggests that the models underestimate the coupling of stratospheric changes to annular variations at the surface and may not simulate the full response to increasing GHGs.},

abstract = {Observations of volcanoes extruding andesitic lava to produce lava domes often reveal cyclic behavior. At Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills Volcano, Montserrat, cycles with subdaily and multiweek periods have been recognized on many occasions. Observations clearly show that the period of subdaily cycles is modulated by the multiweek cycle. The subdaily and multiweek cycles have been modeled separately as stick-slip magma flow at the junction between a dyke and an overlying cylindrical conduit and as the filling and discharge of magma through the elastic-walled dyke, respectively. Here, we couple these two models to describe the behavior over a period of well-observed multiweek cycles, with accompanying subdaily cycles, from 13 May to 21 September 1997. The coupled model captures well the asymmetrical first-order behavior: the first 40% of the multiweek cycle consists of high rates of lava extrusion during short period/high amplitude subdaily cycles as the dyke reservoir discharges itself. The remainder of the cycle involves increasing pressurization as more magma is stored, and extrusion rate falls, followed by a gradual increase in the period of the subdaily cycles.},

abstract = {Spring-neap modulation of tidal mixing could potentially have significant effects on the timing and magnitude of primary production in stratified shelf seas. A 1D turbulence model, coupled to a simple model of primary production, is used to identify potential spring-neap impacts. According to this model, changes in the timing of the spring-neap cycle could contribute 10% of inter-annual variability of bloom timing in weak tidal regimes and 25% in areas with stronger tidal currents. In stratified regions away from the tidal mixing fronts, the spring-neap cycle is predicted to result in periodicity in the biological rates within the thermocline, and the turbulent flux of organic carbon into the bottom water. The strongest impacts are predicted within 15-50 km of the tidal mixing fronts, with increases in sub-surface primary production and carbon export. At the fronts, there is substantial extra primary production driven by the spring-neap cycle, contributing an extra 70% annua!\r\n lly compared to fronts forced by the M-2 tide only. This impact is reflected in the organic carbon mixed downward into the bottom waters near the front. The results have important implications for the interpretation of observations of primary production, and for the resolution required by shelf-wide models of the marine ecosystem},

abstract = {Interactions between the atmosphere and ocean are mediated by the mixed layer at the ocean surface. The depth of this layer is determined by wind forcing and heating from the atmosphere. Variations in mixed-layer depth affect the rate of exchange between the atmosphere and deeper ocean, the capacity of the ocean to store heat and carbon and the availability of light and nutrients to support the growth of phytoplankton. However, the response of the Southern Ocean mixed layer to changes in the atmosphere is not well known. Here we analyse temperature and salinity data from Argo profiling floats to show that the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere, leads to large-scale anomalies in mixed-layer depth that are zonally asymmetric. From a simple heat budget of the mixed layer we conclude that meridional winds associated with departures of the SAM from zonal symmetry cause anomalies in heat flux that can, in turn, explain the observed changes of mixed-layer depth and sea surface temperature. Our results suggest that changes in the SAM, including recent and projected trends attributed to human activity, drive variations in Southern Ocean mixed-layer depth, with consequences for air-sea exchange, ocean sequestration of heat and carbon, and biological productivity.},

abstract = {This study reports on observations of turbulent dissipation and internal wave-scale flow properties in a standing meander of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) north of the Kerguelen Plateau. The au- thors characterize the intensity and spatial distribution of the observed turbulent dissipation and the derived turbulent mixing, and consider underpinning mechanisms in the context of the internal wave field and the processes governing the waves' generation and evolution. The turbulent dissipation rate and the derived diapycnal diffusivity are highly variable with systematic depth dependence. The dissipation rate is generally enhanced in the upper 1000–1500 mof the water column, and both the dissipation rate and diapycnal diffusivity are enhanced in some places near the seafloor, com- monly in regions of rough topography and in the vicinity of strong bottom flows associated with theACCjets. Turbulent dissipation is high in regions where internal wave energy is high, consistent with the idea that interior dissipation is related to a breaking internal wave field. Elevated turbulence occurs in association with downward-propagating near-inertial waves within 1–2 km of the surface, as well as with upward-propagating, relatively high-frequency waves within 1–2 km of the seafloor. While an interpretation of these near-bottom waves as lee waves generated byACCjets flowing over small-scale topographic roughness is supported by the qualitative match between the spatial patterns in predicted lee wave radiation and observed near-bottom dissipation, the observed dissipation is found to be only a small percentage of the energy flux predicted by theory. The mismatch suggests an alternative fate to local dissipation for a significant fraction of the radiated energy},

abstract = {Volcanism on Montserrat (Lesser Antilles arc) has migrated southwards since the formation of the Silver Hills $\sim$ 2.5 Ma, and has formed three successively active volcanic centres. The Centre Hills volcano was the focus of volcanism from $\sim$ 1???0.4 Ma, before activity commenced at the currently active Soufri??re Hills volcano. The history of activity at these two volcanoes provides an opportunity to investigate the pattern of volcano behaviour on an andesitic arc island over the lifetime of individual volcanoes. Here, we describe the pyroclastic stratigraphy of subaerial exposures around central Montserrat; identifying 11 thick (> 1 m) pumiceous units derived from sustained explosive eruptions of Centre Hills from $\sim$ 0.8???0.4 Ma. Over 10 other, less well- exposed pumiceous units have also been identified. The pumice-rich units are interbedded with andesite lava breccias derived from effusive, dome-forming eruptions of Centre Hills. The stratigraphy indicates that large (up to magnitude 5) explosive eruptions occurred throughout the history of Centre Hills, alongside effusive activity. This behaviour at Centre Hills contrasts with Soufri??re Hills, where deposits from sustained explosive eruptions are much less common and restricted to early stages of activity at the volcano, from $\sim$ 175???130 ka. Subsequent eruptions at Soufriere Hills have been dominated by andesitic effusive eruptions. The bulk composition, petrography and mineral chemistry of volcanic rocks from Centre Hills and Soufri??re Hills are similar throughout the history of both volcanoes, except for occasional, transient departures to different magma compositions, which mark shifts in vent location or dominant eruption style. For example, the final recorded eruption of Centre Hills, before the initiation of activity at Soufri??re Hills, was more silicic than any other identified eruption on Montserrat; and the basaltic South Soufri??re Hills episode marked the transition to the current stage of predominantly effusive Soufri??re Hills activity. The compositional stability observed throughout the history of Centre Hills and Soufri??re Hills suggests that a predominance towards effusive or explosive eruption styles is not driven by major compositional shifts of magma, but may reflect local changes in long-term magma storage conditions that characterise individual episodes (on 105 year timescales) of volcanism on Montserrat.},

abstract = {An improved monthly precipitation climatology for the Arctic is developed by blending the Legates and Willmott gridded product with measurements from Russian "North Pole" drifting stations and gauge corrected station data for Eurasia and Canada. The improved climatology is used to examine the accuracy of mean precipitation forecasts from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and European Reanalysis Agency (ERA) reanalysis models, based on data for the period 1979-88. Bath models capture the major spatial features of annual mean precipitation and general aspects of the seasonal cycle but with some notable errors. Both underestimate precipitation over the Atlantic side of the Arctic. NCEP overestimates annual totals over land areas and to a somewhat lesser extent over the central Arctic Ocean. Except for the North Atlantic-Scandinavia sector, the NCEP model also depicts the seasonal precipitation maximum consistently one month early in July. Overall, the ERA predictions are better. Both models perform best during winter and worst during summer. The most significant problem with the NCEP model is a severe oversimulation of summer precipitation over land areas, due to excessive convective precipitation. Further investigation far July reveals that both the NCEP analyses and 12-h forecasts are too wet below about 850 mb and have more negative low-level temperature gradients as compared to available rawinsonde profiles. This suggests that low-level observations are not being effectively incorporated in the analyses. Given this finding, the high humidities are consistent with excessive surface evaporation rates. This problem may in turn relate to soil moisture, which NCEP updates by the modeled precipitation. If soil moisture is too high, this would favor excessive Evaporation and high low-level humidities, fostering excessive precipitation, in turn keeping soil moisture and evaporation rates high. The NCEP down-welling shortwave fluxes are also much too high, contributing to excessive evaporation and possibly influencing the low-lever temperature gradients. By comparison, soil moisture in the ERA model is adjusted using the difference between the model first guess and analysis value (the analysis increment) of low-level humidity, which prevents model drift. The ERA downwelling shortwave fluxes are also closer to observations. These attributes are consistent with the superior ERA precipitation forecasts in summer and suggest avenues for improving the performance of the NCEP model.},

abstract = {Non-linear tidal constituents, such as the overtide M4 or the compound tide MS4, are generated by interaction in shallow seas of the much larger astronomically forced "primary" tidal constituents (e.g., M2, S2). As such, errors in modeling these "secondary" shallow-water tides might be expected to be caused first of all by errors in modeling the primary constituents. Thus, in the context of data assimilation, observations of primary-constituent harmonic constants can indirectly constrain shallow-water constituents. Here we consider variational data assimilation for primary and secondary tidal constituents as a coupled problem, using a simple linearized perturbation theory for weak interactions of the dominant primary constituents. Variation of the resulting penalty functional leads to weakly non-linear Euler-Lagrange equations, which we show can be solved approximately with a simple two-stage scheme. In the first stage, data for the primary constituents are assimilated into the linear shallow water equations (SWE), and the resulting inverse solutions are used to compute the quadratic interactions in the non-linear SWE that constitute the forcing for the secondary constituents. In the second stage, data for the compound or overtide constituent are assimilated into the linear SWE, using a prior forced by the results of the first stage. We apply this scheme to assimilation of TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason altimetry data on the Northwest European Shelf, comparing results to a large set of shelf and coastal tide gauges. Prior solutions for M4, MS4 and MN4 computed using inverse solutions for M2, S2, and N2 dramatically improve fits to validation tide gauges relative to unconstrained forward solutions. Further assimilation of along-track harmonic constants for these shallow-water constituents reduces RMS differences to below 1 cm on the shelf, approaching the accuracy of the validation tide gauge harmonic constants. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distributions of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) are investigated, using monthly data from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis for the period 1980-2004. Patterns of atmospheric forcing are identified in observations of sea level pressure and air-sea heat fluxes. It is found that a significant fraction of SST variability in the ACC can be understood as a linear response to surface forcing by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and remote forcing by ENSO. The physical mechanisms rely on the interplay between atmospheric variability and mean advection by the ACC. SAM and ENSO drive a low-level anomalous circulation pattern localized over the South Pacific Ocean, inducing surface heat fluxes and Ekman heat advection anomalies. A simple model of SST propagating in the ACC, forced with heat fluxes estimated from the reanalysis, suggests that surface heat fluxes and Ekman heat advection are equally important in driving the observed SST variability. Further diagnostics indicate that SST anomalies, generated mainly upstream of Drake Passage, are subsequently advected by the ACC and damped after a couple of years. It is suggested that SST variability along the path of the ACC is largely a passive response of the oceanic mixed layer to atmospheric forcing.},

abstract = {Largely zonal winds in the Southern Ocean drive an equatorward Ekman transport that constitutes the shallowest limb of the meridional overturning circulation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Despite its importance, there have been no direct observations of the open ocean Ekman balance in the Southern Ocean until now. Using high-resolution repeat observations of upper-ocean velocity in Drake Passage, a mean Ekman spiral is resolved and Ekman transport is computed. The mean Ekman currents decay in amplitude and rotate anticyclonically with depth, penetrating to similar to 100-m depth, above the base of the annual mean mixed layer at 120 m. The rotation depth scale exceeds the e-folding scale of the speed by about a factor of 3, resulting in a current spiral that is compressed relative to predictions from Ekman theory. Transport estimated from the observed currents is mostly equatorward and in good agreement with the Ekman transport computed from four different gridded wind products. The mean temperature of the Ekman layer is not distinguishable from temperature at the surface. Turbulent eddy viscosities inferred from Ekman theory and a direct estimate of the time-averaged stress were O(10(2)-10(3)) cm(2) s(-1). The latter calculation results in a profile of eddy viscosity that decreases in magnitude with depth and a time-averaged stress that is not parallel to the time-averaged vertical shear. The compression of the Ekman spiral and the nonparallel shear-stress relation are likely due to time averaging over the cycling of the stratification in response to diurnal buoyancy fluxes, although the action of surface waves and the oceanic response to high-frequency wind variability may also contribute.},

abstract = {A conceptual framework for analysing the energetics of density-stratified Boussinesq fluid flows is discussed. The concept of gravitational available potential energy is used to formulate an energy budget in which the evolution of the background potential energy, i.e. the minimum potential energy attainable through adiabatic motions, can be explicitly examined. For closed systems, the background potential energy can change only due to diabatic processes. The rate of change of background potential energy is proportional to the molecular diffusivity. Changes in the background potential energy provide a direct measure of the potential energy changes due to irreversible diapycnal mixing. For open systems, background potential energy can also change due to boundary fluxes, which can be explicitly measured. The analysis is particularly appropriate for evaluation of diabatic mixing rates in numerical simulations of turbulent flows. The energetics of a shear driven mixing layer is used to illustrate the analysis.},

Here we show that accelerated basal melting of Antarctic ice shelves is likely to have contributed significantly to sea-ice expansion.

Simulating these processes in a coupled climate model we find that cool and fresh surface water from ice-shelf melt indeed leads to expanding sea ice in austral autumn and winter. This powerful negative feedback counteracts Southern Hemispheric atmospheric warming. Although changes in atmospheric dynamics most likely govern regional sea-ice trends4, our analyses indicate that the overall sea-ice trend is dominated by increased ice-shelf melt. We suggest that cool sea surface temperatures around Antarctica could offset projected snowfall increases in Antarctica, with implications for estimates of future sea-level rise.},

abstract = {Interactions between the atmosphere and ocean are mediated by the mixed layer at the ocean surface. The depth of this layer is determined by wind forcing and heating from the atmosphere. Variations in mixed-layer depth affect the rate of exchange between the atmosphere and deeper ocean, the capacity of the ocean to store heat and carbon and the availability of light and nutrients to support the growth of phytoplankton. However, the response of the Southern Ocean mixed layer to changes in the atmosphere is not well known. Here we analyse temperature and salinity data from Argo profiling floats to show that the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere, leads to large-scale anomalies in mixed-layer depth that are zonally asymmetric. From a simple heat budget of the mixed layer we conclude that meridional winds associated with departures of the SAM from zonal symmetry cause anomalies in heat flux that can, in turn, explain the observed changes of mixed-layer depth and sea surface temperature. Our results suggest that changes in the SAM, including recent and projected trends attributed to human activity, drive variations in Southern Ocean mixed-layer depth, with consequences for air-sea exchange, ocean sequestration of heat and carbon, and biological productivity.},

abstract = {Here we present a new assessment of Antarctic climate change over the 21st century based on data from the models that were developed as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report (AR4). To provide more reliable estimates of future change, a weighting scheme was applied to the model output, which depends on a measure of their ability to reproduce the mean climate of the late 20th century. The results show a seasonal variation of increases in circumpolar westerlies around Antarctica, which show the largest increases of 27% in autumn. This seasonal cycle was found to be consistent with projected changes in the semi-annual oscillation (SAO). In summer and autumn the increases of the westerly wind component migrate sufficiently far south to be manifested as a reduction of the coastal easterlies. The surface warming averaged over the continent is projected to be 0.34°C dec−1 with an inter-model standard deviation of 0.10°C dec−1. More rapid warming occurs during the winter over regions of sea ice retreat, e.g., 0.51 ± 0.26°C dec−1 around East Antarctica. Projections of total sea-ice area show a decrease of 2.6 ± 0.73 × 106 km2 (33%). There is a projected increase of net precipitation averaged over the continent of 2.9 ± 1.2 mm a−1 dec−1. The weighting gives a larger increase of the autumn SAO peak, up to 30% larger for April. This is consistent with larger weighted autumn increases of circumpolar westerlies, more sea ice reduction and resulting larger skin temperature increases.},

The circulation phenomena we describe are likely to be prevalent on all similar, wide, tidally energetic continental shelves including those off north-eastern China, Argentina and parts of the Arctic.

abstract = {The circulation pattern and volume transports in the eastern Weddell Gyre are estimated on the basis of hydrographic data collected by R.V. Polarstern between 1989 and 1996. In the northeastern edge of the Weddell Gyre, eastward-flowing water masses from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Weddell Sea converge. Due to the strong effect of topographic constraints on ocean currents in the weakly stratified waters of high latitudes, the wedge-like structure of the Southwest Indian Ridge can cause the convergence. The increased shear leads to instabilities of the current at the eastern end of the ridge, which produce an intense mesoscale eddy field between 15??and 30??E. In the eddies, water from the Weddell cold regime and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current waters mix and form the water masses of the Weddell warm regime. These waters are advected southward and flow towards the westward southern rim current, which is driven by the Antarctic eastwind band. Hence, there is not a continous flow from the northern to the southern rim, but a decay of the mean flow in the northeast and a reformation in the south. Volume transports across the Greenwich Meridian; estimated on the basis of a combined CTD/ADCP data set, result in an eastward flow of 61 Sv in the northern rim current and a westward return flow of 66 Sv in the southern part of the gyre. The transport is about twice as high as previous estimates between Kapp Norvegia and the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, indicating a significant gyre circulation north of 70??S.},

abstract = {Observations over the last 30 yr have shown that the sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean has slightly in- creased since 1979. Mechanisms responsible for this positive trend have not been well established yet. In this study we tackle two related issues: is the observed positive trend com- patible with the internal variability of the system, and do the models agree with what we know about the observed inter- nal variability? For that purpose, we analyse the evolution of sea ice around the Antarctic simulated by 24 different gen- eral circulation models involved in the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), using both historical and hindcast experiments. Our analyses showthat CMIP5 models respond to the forcing, including the one induced by strato- spheric ozone depletion, by reducing the sea ice cover in the Southern Ocean. Some simulations display an increase in sea ice extent similar to the observed one. According to models, the observed positive trend is compatible with internal vari- ability. However, models strongly overestimate the variance of sea ice extent and the initialization methods currently used inmodels do not improve systematically the simulated trends in sea ice extent. On the basis of those results, a critical role of the internal variability in the observed increase of sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean could not be ruled out, but cur- rent models results appear inadequate to test more precisely this hypothesis.},

abstract = {[1] A stream function projection of historical hydrographic data is applied to study the heat flux problem in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The ACC is defined as a circumpolar band consisting of mean streamlines passing through Drake Passage. Its mean path exhibits a globally meandering pattern. The calculation of zonal heat transport shows that the ACC warms along its equatorward segments (South Atlantic and Indian Ocean) and cools along its poleward segment (South Pacific). The primary heat sources for the ACC system are two western boundary currents, the Brazil Current and the Agulhas Current. The mean baroclinic flow relative to 3000 dbar carries 0.14 PW poleward heat flux across 56°S and 0.08 PW across 60°S.},

abstract = {Pyroclastic density currents have been observed to both enter the sea, and to travel over water for tens of kilometers. Here, we identified a 1.2-m-thick, stratified pumice lapilli-ash cored at Site U1396 offshore Montserrat (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program [IODP] Expedition 340) as being the first deposit to provide evidence that it was formed by submarine deposition from pumice-rich pyroclastic density currents that traveled above the water surface. The age of the submarine deposit is ca. 4 Ma, and its magma source is similar to those for much younger Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills deposits, indicating that the island experienced large-magnitude, subaerial caldera-forming explosive eruptions much earlier than recorded in land deposits. The deposit's combined sedimentological characteristics are incompatible with deposition from a submarine eruption, pyroclastic fall over water, or a submarine seafloor-hugging turbidity current derived from a subaerial pyroclastic density current that entered water at the shoreline. The stratified pumice lapilli-ash unit can be subdivided into at least three depositional units, with the lowermost one being clast supported. The unit contains grains in five separate size modes and has a >12 phi range. Particles are chiefly subrounded pumice clasts, lithic clasts, crystal fragments, and glass shards. Pumice clasts are very poorly segregated from other particle types, and lithic clasts occur throughout the deposit; fine particles are weakly density graded. We interpret the unit to record multiple closely spaced (<2 d) hot pyroclastic density currents that flowed over the ocean, releasing pyroclasts onto the water surface, and settling of the various pyroclasts into the water column. Our settling and hot and cold flotation experiments show that waterlogging of pumice clasts at the water surface would have been immediate. The overall poor hydraulic sorting of the deposit resulted from mixing of particles from multiple pulses of vertical settling in the water column, attesting to complex sedimentation. Slow-settling particles were deposited on the seafloor together with faster-descending particles that were delivered at the water surface by subsequent pyroclastic flows. The final sediment pulses were eventually deflected upon their arrival on the seafloor and were deposited in laterally continuous facies. This study emphasizes the interaction between products of explosive volcanism and the ocean and discusses sedimentological complexities and hydrodynamics associated with particle delivery to water.},

The presence of another source has been identified in hydrographic and tracer data, although the site of formation is not well constrained. Here we document the formation of dense shelf water in the Cape Darnley polynya (65◦–69◦ E) and its subsequent transformation into bottom water using data from moorings and instrumented elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). Unlike the previously identified sources of Antarctic Bottom Water, which require the presence of an ice shelf or a large storage volume, bottom water production at the Cape Darnley polynya is driven primarily by the flux of salt released by sea-ice formation. We estimate that about 0.3–0.7×106m3 s−1 of dense shelf water produced by the Cape Darnley polynya is transformed into Antarctic BottomWater.

These data sampled a baroclinic, middepth eddy formed during the disintegration of a deep boundary current. Turbulent dissipation is suppressed within the eddy but is elevated by up to an order of magnitude along the upper and lower eddy boundaries. A ray tracing approximation is employed as a heuristic device to elucidate how the internal wave field evolves in the ambient velocity and stratification conditions accompanying the eddy. These calculations are consistent with the observations, suggesting reflection of internal wave energy from the eddy center and enhanced breaking through critical layer processes along the eddy boundaries. These results have important implications for understanding where and how internal wave energy is dissipated in the presence of energetic deep geostrophic flows.},

It comprises enhanced northward Ekman drift, inducing negative summertime SST anomalies around Antarctica, earlier sea ice freeze-up the following winter, and northward expansion of the sea ice edge year-round. The enhanced northward Ekman drift, however, results in upwelling of warm waters from below the mixed layer in the region of seasonal sea ice. With sustained bursts of westerly winds induced by ozone hole depletion, this warming from below eventually dominates over the cooling from anomalous Ekman drift.

abstract = {Differentiation of natural process units is promoted as a means of better understanding the interconnected nature of coastal systems at various scales. This paper presents a new holistic methodology for the identification of littoral cells. Testing is undertaken through application to an extensive region of central southern England. Diverse sources of information are compiled to map a detailed series of local sediment circulations both at the shoreline and in the offshore zone. Cells and sub-cells are subsequently defined by thorough examination of the continuity of sediment transport pathways and by identification of boundaries where there are discontinuities. Important distinctions are made between the nature and stability of different boundaries and a classification of types is devised. Application of sediment budget analysis to major process units helps to clarify the regional significance of different sediment sources, stores and sinks. Within the study area, it is shown that sediments circulate from distinct eroding cliff sources to well defined sinks. Natural beaches are transient and dependent upon the continued functioning of supply pathways from cliff sources. Relict cells with residual circulations are identified as a consequence of interference. Littoral cell boundaries separate independent coastal units from those that are partially, or totally dependent so the spatial impacts of various processes and practices can be discerned. They identify appropriate units for management, from which new co-operative groupings of local authorities can develop.},

abstract = {Abstract Observations and inverse models suggest that small-scale turbulent mixing is enhanced in the Southern Ocean in regions above rough topography. The enhancement extends O(1) km above the topography, suggesting that mixing is supported by the breaking of gravity waves radiated from the ocean bottom. In this study, it is shown that the observed mixing rates can be sustained by internal waves generated by geostrophic motions flowing over bottom topography. Weakly nonlinear theory is used to describe the internal wave generation and the feedback of the waves on the zonally averaged flow. Vigorous inertial oscillations are driven at the ocean bottom by waves generated at steep topography. The wave radiation and dissipation at equilibrium is therefore the result of both geostrophic flow and inertial oscillations differing substantially from the classical lee-wave problem. The theoretical predictions are tested versus two-dimensional high-resolution numerical simulations with parameters representative of Drake Passage. This work suggests that mixing in Drake Passage can be supported by geostrophic motions impinging on rough topography rather than by barotropic tidal motions, as is commonly assumed.},

The gyre is present each year only during spring and summer (the surface heating season), and circulates around a static dome of cold bottom water left beneath the thermocline after the previous winter. The mud substrate of the western Irish Sea is geographically isolated and is the habitat for adult Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). In spring, newly hatched larvae are released into the water column, spending approximately 50 days in the plankton. Recruitment depends upon settlement of metamorphosed larvae onto the mud patch. Larval distributions show a strong correspondence to the field of stratification and it is probable that the gyre acts as a retention mechanism, helping to maintain the population on the mud patch.},

We present evidence that recent trends in the SH tropospheric circulation can be interpreted as a bias toward the high-index polarity of this pattern, with stronger westerly flow encircling the polar cap. It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau.},

abstract = {Available, potential energy (APE) is defined as the difference between total potential plus internal energy of a fluid in a gravity field and a corresponding reference field in which the fluid is redistributed (leveled) adiabatically to have constant stably-stratified densities along geopotential surfaces. Potential energy changes result from local shifts of fluid mass relative to geopotential surfaces that are accompanied by local changes of enthalpy and internal energy and global shifts of mass (because volumes of fluid elements are not conserved) that do not change enthalpy or internal energy. The potential energy changes are examined separately by computing available gravitational potential energy (GPE) per unit mass and total GPE (TGPE) per unit area. A technique for estimating GPF, in the ocean is developed by introducing a reference density field (or an equivalent specific volume anomaly field) that is a function of pressure only and is connected to the observed field by adiabatic vertical displacements. The full empirical equation of state for seawater is used in the computational algorithm. The accuracy of the estimate is limited by the data and sampling and not by the algorithm itself, which can be made as precise as desired. The reference density field defined locally for an ocean region allows redefinition of dynamic height $\Delta$D (potential energy per unit mass) relative to the reference field. TGPE per unit area becomes simply the horizontal average of dynamic height integrated over depth in the region considered. The reference density surfaces provide a precise approximation to material surfaces for tracing conservative variables such as salinity and potential temperature and for estimating vortex stretching between surfaces. The procedure is applied to the MODE density data collected in 1973. For each group of stations within five 2-week time windows (designated Groups A–E) the estimated GPE is compared with the net APE based on the Boussinesq approximation and to the low-frequency kinetic energy measured from moored buoys. Changes of potential energy of the reference field from one time window to the next are large compared with the GPE within each window, indicating the presence of scales larger than the station grid. An analysis of errors has been made to show the sensitivity of the estimates to data accuracy and sampling frequency.},

Examples include SST fluctuations in the Southern Ocean associated with the Southern Annular Mode, a tripolar pattern of SST anomalies in the North Atlantic associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, and a pan-Pacific mode known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (with additional contributions from oceanic processes). They may also result from coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions, such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the tropical Indo-Pacific, the tropical Atlantic Ni{\~{n}}o, and the cross-equatorial meridional modes in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic.

In contrast to a previous study, our simulations show that the fresh water effect on sea-ice trends over the historical period is small and fails to reproduce the observed regional pattern of trends, when using observationally consistent rates of fresh water forcing. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP5) models do not represent this dynamic ice-sheet mass loss, and it has been suggested this deficiency may significantly influence the simulated sea-ice trends. We show that when accounting for internal variability, the average CMIP5 sea-ice area trend is statistically consistent with the observed trend, and accounting for ice sheet derived fresh water forcing has little influence.},

abstract = {The two polar regions have experienced remarkably different climatic changes in recent decades. The Arctic has seen a marked reduction in sea-ice extent throughout the year, with a peak during the autumn. A new record minimum extent occurred in 2007, which was 40% below the long-term climatological mean. In contrast, the extent of Antarctic sea ice has increased, with the greatest growth being in the autumn. There has been a large-scale warming across much of the Arctic, with a resultant loss of permafrost and a reduction in snow cover. The bulk of the Antarctic has experienced little change in surface temperature over the last 50 years, although a slight cooling has been evident around the coast of East Antarctica since about 1980, and recent research has pointed to a warming across West Antarctica. The exception is the Antarctic Peninsula, where there has been a winter (summer) season warming on the western (eastern) side. Many of the different changes observed between the two polar regions can be attributed to topographic factors and land/sea distribution. The location of the Arctic Ocean at high latitude, with the consequently high level of solar radiation received in summer, allows the ice-albedo feedback mechanism to operate effectively. The Antarctic ozone hole has had a profound effect on the circulations of the high latitude ocean and atmosphere, isolating the continent and increasing the westerly winds over the Southern Ocean, especially during the summer and winter.},

Application of the exact definitions to the ocean reveals the dynamic role of internal mixing and surface thermal forcing.

abstract = {Observations show that, in contrast to the Arctic, the area of Antarctic sea ice has increased since 1979. A potential driver of this significant increase relates to the mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet. Subsurface ocean warming causes basal ice-shelf melt, freshening the surface waters around Antarctica, which leads to increases in sea-ice cover. With climate warming ongoing, future mass-loss rates are projected to accelerate, which has the potential to affect future Antarctic sea-ice trends. Here we investigate to what extent future sea-ice trends are influenced by projected increases in Antarctic freshwater flux due to subsurface melt, using a state-of-the-art global climate model (EC-Earth) in standardized Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) climate-change simulations. Virtually all CMIP5 models disregard ocean-ice-sheet interactions and project strongly retreating Antarctic sea ice. Applying various freshwater flux scenarios, we find that the additional fresh water significantly offsets the decline in sea-ice area and is even able to reverse the trend in the strongest freshwater forcing scenario that can reasonably be expected, especially in austral winter. The model also simulates decreasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with the SST trends exhibiting strong regional variations that largely correspond to regional sea-ice trends.},

These are ubiquitous above sharp horizontal gradients in bottom temperatures and/or salinities. The circulation phenomena we describe are likely to be prevalent on all similar, wide, tidally energetic continental shelves including those off north-eastern China, Argentina and parts of the Arctic.

abstract = {Rivers are the dominant source of many elements and isotopes to the ocean. But this input from the continents is not balanced by the loss of the elements and isotopes through hydrothermal and sedimentary exchange with the oceanic crust, or by temporal changes in the marine inventory for elements that are demonstrably not in steady state. To resolve the problem of the observed imbalance in marine geochemical budgets, attention has been focused on uncertainties in the hydrothermal and sedimentary fluxes. In recent Earth history, temporally dynamic chemical weathering fluxes from the continents are an inevitable consequence of periodic glaciations. Chemical weathering rates on modern Earth are likely to remain far from equilibrium owing to the physical production of finely ground material at glacial terminations that acts as a fertile substrate for chemical weathering. Here we explore the implications of temporal changes in the riverine chemical weathering flux for oceanic geochemical budgets. We contend that the riverine flux obtained from observations of modern rivers is broadly accurate, but not representative of timescales appropriate for elements with oceanic residence longer than Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. We suggest that the pulse of rapid chemical weathering initiated at the last deglaciation has not yet decayed away and that weathering rates remain about two to three times the average for an entire late Quaternary glacial cycle. Taking into account the effect of the suggested non-steady-state process on the silicate weathering flux helps to reconcile the modelled marine strontium isotope budget with available data. Overall, we conclude that consideration of the temporal variability in riverine fluxes largely ameliorates long-standing problems with chemical and isotopic mass balances in the ocean.},

But the magnitude and distribution of mixing across density surfaces are also important for the Earth's climate as well as the concentrations of organisms(1). Most of this mixing occurs where internal waves break, overturning the density stratification of the ocean and creating patches of turbulence. Predictions of the rate at which internal waves dissipate(2,3) were confirmed earlier at midlatitudes(4,5). Here we present observations of temperature and velocity fluctuations in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans between 42degreesN and 2degreesS to extend that result to equatorial regions. We find a strong latitude dependence of dissipation in accordance with the predictions(3). In our observations, dissipation rates and accompanying mixing across density surfaces near the Equator are less than 10% of those at mid-latitudes for a similar background of internal waves. Reduced mixing close to the Equator will have to be taken into account in numerical simulations of ocean dynamics-for example, in climate change experiments.},

The annual primary production predicted by the model (47.7 Gt C yr\) compares well to the estimates made by Longhurst et al. (1995, J. Plankton Res., 17, 1245) and Antoine et al. (1996, Global Biogeochem. Cycles, 10, 57). The HadOCC model "nds high production in the sub-polar North Paci"c and North Atlantic Oceans, and around the Antarctic convergence, and low production in the sub-tropical gyres. However in disagreement with the observations of Longhurst et al. and Antoine et al., the model predicts very high production in the eastern equatorial Paci"c Ocean. The export #ux of carbon in the model agrees well with data from deep-water sediment traps. In order to examine the factors controlling production in the ocean, additional simulations have been run. A nutrient-restoring simulation con"rms that the areas with the highest primary production are those with the greatest nutrient supply. A reduced wind-stress experiment demonstrates that the high production found in the equatorial Paci"c is driven by excessive upwelling of nutrient-rich water. Three further simulations show that nutrient supply at high latitudes, and hence production there, is sensitive to the parameters and climatological forcings of the mixed layer sub-model. Crown},

abstract = {Spring-neap modulation of tidal mixing could potentially have significant effects on the timing and magnitude of primary production in stratified shelf seas. A 1D turbulence model, coupled to a simple model of primary production, is used to identify potential spring-neap impacts. According to this model, changes in the timing of the spring-neap cycle could contribute 10% of inter-annual variability of bloom timing in weak tidal regimes and 25% in areas with stronger tidal currents. In stratified regions away from the tidal mixing fronts, the spring-neap cycle is predicted to result in periodicity in the biological rates within the thermocline, and the turbulent flux of organic carbon into the bottom water. The strongest impacts are predicted within 15-50 km of the tidal mixing fronts, with increases in sub-surface primary production and carbon export. At the fronts, there is substantial extra primary production driven by the spring-neap cycle, contributing an extra 70% annua!\r\n lly compared to fronts forced by the M-2 tide only. This impact is reflected in the organic carbon mixed downward into the bottom waters near the front. The results have important implications for the interpretation of observations of primary production, and for the resolution required by shelf-wide models of the marine ecosystem},

abstract = {The impact of small- scale topography on the ocean's dynamical balance is investigated by quantifying the rates at which internal wave drag extracts (angular) momentum and vorticity from the general circulation. The calculation exploits the recent advent of two near- global descriptions of topographic roughness on horizontal scales on the order of 1- 10 km, which play a central role in the generation of internal lee waves by geostrophic flows impinging on topography and have been hitherto unresolved by bathymetric datasets and ocean general circulation models alike. It is found that, while internal wave drag is a minor contributor to the ocean's dynamical balance over much of the globe, it is a significant player in the dynamics of extensive areas of the ocean, most notably the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and several regions of enhanced small- scale topographic variance in the equatorial and Southern Hemisphere oceans. There, the contribution of internal wave drag to the ocean's (angular) momentum and vorticity balances is generally on the order of ten to a few tens of percent of the dominant source and sink terms in each dynamical budget, which are respectively associated with wind forcing and form drag by topography with horizontal scales from 500 to 1000 km. It is thus suggested that the representation of internal wave drag in general circulation models may lead to significant changes in the deep ocean circulation of those regions. A theoretical scaling is derived that captures the basic dependence of internal wave drag on topographic roughness and near- bottom flow speed for most oceanographically relevant regimes.},

Over twenty years of sea ice extent, ice motion and reanalysed near-surface wind data are used to establish that winter ice extent in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region is largely determined by the meridional (north-south) atmospheric circulation. A remarkably strong ice extent-wind relationship is found in the WAP. No other Antarctic or comparable sub-Arctic sea ice region shows this. Ice motion data confirm wind-induced drift is crucial for extensive winter ice to occur. Reasons for winter ice extent and winds being more strongly correlated in the WAP than in other parts of the Antarctic are discussed along with implications for understanding the observed warming.},

abstract = {This study reports on observations of turbulent dissipation and internal wave-scale flow properties in a standing meander of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) north of the Kerguelen Plateau. The authors characterize the intensity and spatial distribution of the observed turbulent dissipation and the derived turbulent mixing, and consider underpinning mechanisms in the context of the internal wave field and the processes governing the waves' generation and evolution. The turbulent dissipation rate and the derived diapycnal diffusivity are highly variable with systematic depth dependence. The dissipation rate is generally enhanced in the upper 1000–1500 m of the water column, and both the dissipation rate and diapycnal diffusivity are enhanced in some places near the seafloor, commonly in regions of rough topography and in the vicinity of strong bottom flows associated with the ACC jets. Turbulent dissipation is high in regions where internal wave energy is high, consistent with the idea that interior dissipation is related to a breaking internal wave field. Elevated turbulence occurs in association with downward-propagating near-inertial waves within 1–2 km of the surface, as well as with upward-propagating, relatively high-frequency waves within 1–2 km of the seafloor. While an interpretation of these near-bottom waves as lee waves generated by ACC jets flowing over small-scale topographic roughness is supported by the qualitative match between the spatial patterns in predicted lee wave radiation and observed near-bottom dissipation, the observed dissipation is found to be only a small percentage of the energy flux predicted by theory. The mismatch suggests an alternative fate to local dissipation for a significant fraction of the radiated energy.},

abstract = {Comparison between proxies for atmospheric circulation and temperature reveals as-sociations over the last few decades that are inconsistent with those of the past 2000 years. Notably, patterns of middle to high latitude atmospheric circulation in both hemi-spheres are still within the range of variability of the last 6–10 centuries while, as 5 demonstrated by Mann and Jones (2003), Northern Hemisphere temperatures over recent decades are the highest of the last 2000 years. Further, recent temperature change precedes change in middle to high latitude atmospheric circulation unlike the two most notable changes in climate of the past 2000 years during which change in atmospheric circulation preceded or coincided with change in temperature. In addition, 10 the most prominent change in Southern Hemisphere temperature and atmospheric cir-culation of the past 2000, and probably 9000 years, precedes change in temperature and atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere unlike the recent change in Northern Hemisphere temperature that leads. These findings provide new verification that recent rise in temperature is inconsistent with natural climate variability and is most 15 likely related to anthropogenic activity in the form of enhanced greenhouse gases. From our investigation we conclude that the delayed warming over much of the Southern Hemisphere may be, in addition to other factors, a consequence of underpin-ning by natural climate variability. Further bipolar comparison of proxy records of atmo-spheric circulation demonstrates that change in atmospheric circulation in the South-20 ern Hemisphere led by 400 years, the most abrupt change in Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation of the last 9000 years. This finding may be highly relevant to understanding a future when warming becomes more fully established in the Southern Hemisphere. 328 CPD 2, 327–355, 2006},

abstract = {The ongoing eruption of the Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills Volcano, Montserrat, has been accompanied throughout by varying levels of high-frequency, 'volcanotectonic' (VT), seismicity. These earthquakes reflect the brittle response of the host rock to stresses generated within the magmatic system and thus reveal interesting and useful information about the structure of the volcanic conduit system and processes occurring within it. In general, systematic changes in the rate, location, and fault-plane solutions of VT earthquakes correspond to changes in the volcano's behavior, and indicate that the main conduit for the eruption is a dike or system of dikes trending NE-SW and centered beneath the eruptive vent. To date, the eruption has comprised three extrusive phases, separated by two $\sim$ 1-2 year-long periods of residual activity. Prior to the start of each extrusive phase, VT earthquakes with fault-plane solution p-axes oriented perpendicular to inferred regional maximum compression dominate the data set, consistent with stresses induced by the inflation of the mid-level conduit system. $\sim$ 90°-rotated VT fault-plane solutions are also observed preceding a change in eruption style from effusive to explosive in 1997. While increases in the rate of VT earthquakes precede eruption phase onsets, high rates of VT seismicity are also observed during the first period of residual activity and in this case appear to reflect the relaxation of host rock following withdrawal of magma from the mid-crustal system. Most VT earthquakes are located directly beneath the eruptive vent, although two 'distal VT clusters' were observed during the first six months of the eruption (late 1995-early 1996). Both of these distal clusters likely resulted from stresses generated during the establishment of the main conduit system. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An established one-dimensional (1-D) model of Shelf Sea Physics and Primary Production (S2P3) is adapted for flexible use in selected regional settings over selected periods of time. This Regional adaptation of S2P3, the S2P3-R framework (v1.0), can be efficiently used to investigate physical and biological phenomena in shelf seas that are strongly controlled by vertical processes. These include spring blooms that follow the onset of stratification, tidal mixing fronts that seasonally develop at boundaries between mixed and stratified water, and sub-surface chlorophyll maxima that persist throughout summer. While not representing 3-D processes, S2P3-R reveals the horizontal variation of the key 1-D (vertical) processes. S2P3-R should therefore only be used in regions where horizontal processes – including mean flows, eddy fluxes and internal tides – are known to exert a weak influence in comparison with vertical processes. In such cases, S2P3-R may be used as a highly versatile research tool, alongside more complex and computationally expensive models. In undergraduate oceanography modules and research projects, the model serves as an effective practical tool for linking theory and field observations. Three different regional configurations of S2P3-R are described, illustrating a range of diagnostics, evaluated where practical with observations. The model can be forced with daily meteorological variables for any selected year in the reanalysis era (1948 onwards). Example simulations illustrate the considerable extent of synoptic-to-interannual variability in the physics and biology of shelf seas. In discussion, the present limitations of S2P3-R are emphasised, and future developments are outlined.},

abstract = {Pyroclastic density currents have been observed to both enter the sea, and to travel over water for tens of kilometers. Here, we identified a 1.2-m-thick, stratified pumice lapilli-ash cored at Site U1396 offshore Montserrat (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program [IODP] Expedition 340) as being the first deposit to provide evidence that it was formed by submarine deposition from pumice-rich pyroclastic density currents that traveled above the water surface. The age of the submarine deposit is ca. 4 Ma, and its magma source is similar to those for much younger Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills deposits, indicating that the island experienced large-magnitude, subaerial caldera-forming explosive eruptions much earlier than recorded in land deposits. The deposit's combined sedimentological characteristics are incompatible with deposition from a submarine eruption, pyroclastic fall over water, or a submarine seafloor-hugging turbidity current derived from a subaerial pyroclastic density current that entered water at the shoreline. The stratified pumice lapilli-ash unit can be subdivided into at least three depositional units, with the lowermost one being clast supported. The unit contains grains in five separate size modes and has a >12 phi range. Particles are chiefly subrounded pumice clasts, lithic clasts, crystal fragments, and glass shards. Pumice clasts are very poorly segregated from other particle types, and lithic clasts occur throughout the deposit; fine particles are weakly density graded. We interpret the unit to record multiple closely spaced (<2 d) hot pyroclastic density currents that flowed over the ocean, releasing pyroclasts onto the water surface, and settling of the various pyroclasts into the water column. Our settling and hot and cold flotation experiments show that waterlogging of pumice clasts at the water surface would have been immediate. The overall poor hydraulic sorting of the deposit resulted from mixing of particles from multiple pulses of vertical settling in the water column, attesting to complex sedimentation. Slow-settling particles were deposited on the seafloor together with faster-descending particles that were delivered at the water surface by subsequent pyroclastic flows.

Climate warming may increase snowfall in the continent's interior1, 2, 3, but enhance glacier discharge at the coast where warmer air and ocean temperatures erode the buttressing ice shelves4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Here, we use satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar observations from 1992 to 2006 covering 85% of Antarctica's coastline to estimate the total mass flux into the ocean. We compare the mass fluxes from large drainage basin units with interior snow accumulation calculated from a regional atmospheric climate model for 1980 to 2004. In East Antarctica, small glacier losses in Wilkes Land and glacier gains at the mouths of the Filchner and Ross ice shelves combine to a near-zero loss of 4±61 Gt yr−1. In West Antarctica, widespread losses along the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas increased the ice sheet loss by 59% in 10 years to reach 132±60 Gt yr−1 in 2006. In the Peninsula, losses increased by 140% to reach 60±46 Gt yr−1 in 2006. Losses are concentrated along narrow channels occupied by outlet glaciers and are caused by ongoing and past glacier acceleration. Changes in glacier flow therefore have a significant, if not dominant impact on ice sheet mass balance.},

abstract = {Abstract Estimates of sea ice extent based on satellite observations show an increasing Antarctic sea ice cover from 1979 to 2004 even though in situ observations show a prevailing warming trend in both the atmosphere and the ocean. This riddle is explored here using a global multicategory thickness and enthalpy distribution sea ice model coupled to an ocean model. Forced by the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis data, the model simulates an increase of 0.20 × 1012 m3 yr−1 (1.0% yr−1) in total Antarctic sea ice volume and 0.084 × 1012 m2 yr−1 (0.6% yr−1) in sea ice extent from 1979 to 2004 when the satellite observations show an increase of 0.027 × 1012 m2 yr−1 (0.2% yr−1) in sea ice extent during the same period. The model shows that an increase in surface air temperature and downward longwave radiation results in an increase in the upper-ocean temperature and a decrease in sea ice growth, leading to a decrease in salt rejection from ice, in the upper-ocean salinity, and in the upper-ocean density.

This paper presents laboratory, field, and numerical model evidence of errors in ADCP measurements caused by flow disturbance. A state-of-the-art three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic model is validated with and used to complement field and laboratory observations of flow disturbance and its effect on measured velocities. Results show that near the instrument, flow velocities measured by the ADCP are neither the undisturbed stream velocity nor the velocity of the flow field around the ADCP. The velocities measured by the ADCP are biased low due to the downward flow near the upstream face of the ADCP and upward recovering flow in the path of downstream transducer, which violate the flow homogeneity assumption used to transform beam velocities into Cartesian velocity components. The magnitude of the bias is dependent on the deployment configuration, the diameter of the instrument, and the approach velocity, and was observed to range from more than 25% at 5 cm from the transducers to less than 1% at about 50 cm from the transducers for the scenarios simulated.},

However, depending on the time window for analysis, none or very few individual model simulations show trends comparable to observations. If the multi-model ensemble mean time series provides a true representation of forced change by greenhouse gas (GHG) loading, 33–38% of the observed September trend from 1953–2006 is externally forced, growing to 47–57% from 1979–2006. Given evidence that as a group, the models underestimate the GHG response, the externally forced component may be larger.

abstract = {The spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation rates and internal wavefield characteristics is analyzed across two contrasting regimes of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), using microstructure and finestructure data collected as part of the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES). Mid-depth turbulent dissipation rates are found to increase from \nO(1×10−10Wkg −1) in the Southeast Pacific to \nO(1×10−9Wkg −1) in the Scotia Sea, typically reaching \n3×10−9Wkg −1 within a kilometer of the seabed. Enhanced levels of turbulent mixing are associated with strong near-bottom flows, rough topography, and regions where the internal wavefield is found to have enhanced energy, a less-inertial frequency content and a dominance of upward propagating energy. These results strongly suggest that bottom-generated internal waves play a major role in determining the spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation in the ACC. The energy flux associated with the bottom internal wave generation process is calculated using wave radiation theory, and found to vary between 0.8 mW m−2 in the Southeast Pacific and 14 mW m−2 in the Scotia Sea. Typically, 10%–30% of this energy is found to dissipate within 1 km of the seabed. Comparison between turbulent dissipation rates inferred from finestructure parameterizations and microstructure-derived estimates suggests a significant departure from wave-wave interaction physics in the near-field of wave generation sites.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of Antarctic intermediate water (AAIW) formation and ventilation remains a matter of debate. Some studies suggest that AAIW forms nearly homogeneously in a circumpolar pattern, whereas others favor more localized formation particularly in the southeast Pacific Ocean. We show here that the patterns and magnitude of AAIW formation and ventilation are substantially affected by mesoscale eddies. To diagnose the role of eddies, we made global CFC-11 simulations in two versions of the ocean general circulation model OPA9, a "non-eddying", coarse-resolution version (2{ring operator} cos ??{symbol} ?? 2{ring operator}, ORCA2) and an "eddying" or eddy-permitting version (frac(1, 2){ring operator} cos ??{symbol} ?? frac(1, 2){ring operator}, ORCA05). In the non-eddying simulation, AAIW subducts in a near homogeneous, circumpolar pattern; in the eddying simulation, the distribution of AAIW ventilation is patchier. Increasing resolution causes the AAIW layer to thin by 32% on average in the Indian sector, but only by 11% in the Pacific sector. This patchiness appears due to the zonal wind stress, which is weak over much of the Pacific and southwest Atlantic sectors but is strong over the Indian sector. Consequently, the effect of eddies is largest in the Indian Ocean, moderate in the Atlantic, and smallest in the Pacific basin. Although the Gent and McWilliams (GM) eddy parameterization improves the overall vertical structure of density in the Southern Ocean, applying it in our non-eddying model still results in the nearly uniform circumpolar distribution of AAIW ventilation, in contrast to the observations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We compare new observationally-based data sets of Antarctic near-surface air temperature and snowfall accumulation with 20th century simulations from global climate models (GCMs) that support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Annual Antarctic snowfall accumulation trends in the GCMs agree with observations during 1960-1999, and the sensitivity of snowfall accumulation to near-surface air temperature fluctuations is approximately the same as observed, about 5% K-1. Thus if Antarctic temperatures rise as projected, snowfall increases may partially offset ice sheet mass loss by mitigating an additional 1 mm y(-1) of global sea level rise by 2100. However, 20th century (1880-1999) annual Antarctic near-surface air temperature trends in the GCMs are about 2.5-to-5 times larger-than-observed, possibly due to the radiative impact of unrealistic increases in water vapor. Resolving the relative contributions of dynamic and radiative forcing on Antarctic temperature variability in GCMs will lead to more robust 21st century projections.},

abstract = {Standard scientific operations on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 204 documented a horizon of massive gas hydrate and highly saline pore water ∼0-20 m below the southern summit of Hydrate Ridge offshore Oregon. The sediment zone lies near active seafloor gas venting, raising the possibility that free gas co-exists with gas hydrate in shallow subsurface layers where pore waters have become too saline to precipitate additional gas hydrate. Here we discuss a unique experiment that addresses this important concept. A 1-m-long pressurized core was retrieved from ∼14 m below sea floor at Site 1249 and slowly degassed at ∼0 °C in the laboratory over ∼178 h to determine in situ salinity and gas concentrations in the interval of massive gas hydrate. The core released ∼95 l of gas (predominantly methane), by far the greatest gas volume ever measured for a 1 m core at ambient shipboard pressure and temperature conditions. Geochemical mass-balance calculations and the pressure of initial gas release (4.2 MPa) both imply that pore waters had an in situ salinity approaching or exceeding 105 g kg-1, the approximate salinity required for a gas hydrate-free gas-brine system. Relatively high concentrations of propane and higher hydrocarbon gases at the start of core degassing also suggest the presence of in situ free gas. Gas hydrate, free gas and brine likely co-exist in shallow sediment of Hydrate Ridge. Near-seafloor brines, produced when rapid gas hydrate crystallization extracts large quantities of water, impact the distribution and cycling of gas and gas hydrate in this region and perhaps elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The generation of internal waves by the interaction of deep ocean flows with bottom topography is considered. The interaction of quasi-steady currents with the bottom topography is found to produce an internal wave drag and associated momentum flux of roughly 1/2 dyn/cm2, which is comparable to the average wind stress on the ocean surface. The waves are probably dissipated by critical layer phenomena in the lowest kilometer or so of the ocean, the results being a wave-induced vertical mixing coefficient of order 10 cm2/s in that portion of the water column. The interaction of the barotropic tide with the bottom topography is found to result in a flux of energy of order 1 erg/cm2s into the internal tide, which may represent a nonnegligible sink of the tidal energy. This mechanism appears to be capable of supplying a significant portion of the observed internal wave energy in the ocean. The internal tide is probably dissipated by inherently nonlinear phenomena: spectral transport by weak interactions and, in the upper oceans, strong interactions manifested by localized instabilities resulting in isolated patches of turbulence.},

abstract = {In 1974, newly available satellite observations unveiled the presence of a giant ice-free area, or polynya, within the Antarctic ice pack of theWeddell Sea, which persisted during the two following winters1 . Subsequent research showed that deep convective overturning had opened a conduit between the surface and the abyssal ocean, and had maintained the polynya through the massive release of heat from the deep sea2,3 . Although the polynya has aroused continued interest1–9 , the presence of a fresh surface layer has prevented the recurrence of deep convection there since 19768 , and it is now largely viewed as a naturally rare event10 . Here, we present a new analysis of historical observations and model simulations that suggest deep convection in theWeddell Sea was more active in the past, and has been weakened by anthropogenic forcing. The observations show that surface freshening of the southern polar ocean since the 1950s has considerably enhanced the salinity stratification. Meanwhile, among the present generation of global climate models, deep convection is common in the Southern Ocean under pre-industrial conditions, but weakens and ceases under a climate change scenario owing to surface freshening.Adecline of open-ocean convection would reduce the production rate of Antarctic Bottom Waters, with important implications for ocean heat and carbon storage, and may have played a role in recent Antarctic climate change.

@article{Sharples1999,
abstract = {A 1-dimensional (vertical) physical-biological coupled model is presented. The model is designed for investigations into the link between the vertical turbulent structure of a coastal or shelf sea water column, and the primary production. The physical model employs a turbulence closure scheme to provide the link between local vertical stability (driven by seasonal solar heating) and the vertical turbulent mixing (driven by tidal currents and surface wind stress). The biological component of the model is a simple cell quota, threshold limitation model, with either 1 or 2 taxa/species of phytoplankton growing in response to light and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. The user has control over all model physical and biological driving parameters. Graphical screen output, suitable for basic visualisation and teaching purposes, is generated as the model operates, and more detailed data are written to files for later analysis. In order to demonstrate the model's use in simple hypothesis investigation, an example of the model operation is illustrated. This focuses on the effect that the springs-neaps tidal cycle has on the production within the summer sub-surface biomass maximum, illustrating the fortnightly input of new nitrogen into the thermocline and the subsequent new production.

@article{Cassidy2013,
abstract = {This contribution describes two mass movement deposits (total volume $\sim$0.5km3) identified in seven marine cores located 8 to 15km offshore southern Montserrat, West Indies. The deposits were emplaced in the last 35ka and have not previously been recognised in either the subaerial or distal submarine records. Age constraints, provided by radiocarbon dating, show that an explosive volcanic eruption occurred at ca 8-12ka, emplacing a primary eruption-related deposit that overlies a large ($\sim$0.3km3) reworked bioclastic and volcaniclastic flow deposit, formed from a shelf collapse between 8 and 35ka. The origin of these deposits has been deduced through the correlation of marine sediment cores, component analysis and geochemical analysis. The 8-12ka primary volcanic deposit was likely derived from a highly-erosive pyroclastic flow from the Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcano that entered the ocean and mixed with the water column forming a water-supported density current. Previous investigations of the eruption record suggested that there was a hiatus in activity at the Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcano between 16 and 6ka. The ca 8-12ka eruptive episode identified here shows that this hiatus was shorter than previously hypothesised, and thus highlights the importance of obtaining an accurate and complete marine record of events offshore from volcanic islands and incorporating such data into eruption history reconstructions. Comparisons with the submarine deposit characteristics of the 2003 dome collapse also suggests that the $\sim$8-12ka eruptive episode was more explosive than eruptions from the current eruptive episode. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

The data were interpreted as being representative of the background internal wave field, and thus, despite some evidence of excess downward energy propagation associated with coherent near-inertial features that was interpreted in terms of atmospheric generation, these data provided the basis for a revision to the Garrett and Munk spectral model. These data are reinterpreted through the lens of 30 years of research. Rather than representing the background wave field, atmospheric generation, or even near-inertial wave trapping, the coherent high wavenumber features are characteristic of internal wave capture in a mesoscale strain field. Wave capture represents a generalization of critical layer events for flows lacking the spatial symmetry inherent in a parallel shear flow or isolated vortex.},

abstract = {Ocean overturning circulation requires a continuous thermodynamic transformation of the buoyancy of seawater. The steeply sloping isopycnals of the Southern Ocean provide a pathway for Circumpolar Deep Water to upwell from mid depth without strong diapycnal mixing, where it is transformed directly by surface fluxes of heat and freshwater and splits into an upper and lower branch. While brine rejection from sea ice is thought to contribute to the lower branch, the role of sea ice in the upper branch is less well understood, partly due to a paucity of observations of sea-ice thickness and transport. Here we quantify the sea-ice freshwater flux using the Southern Ocean State Estimate, a state-of-the-art data assimilation that incorporates millions of ocean and ice observations. We then use the water-mass transformation framework to compare the relative roles of atmospheric, sea-ice, and glacial freshwater fluxes, heat fluxes, and upper-ocean mixing in transforming buoyancy within the upper branch. We find that sea ice is a dominant term, with differential brine rejection and ice melt transforming upwelled Circumpolar Deep Water at a rate of $\sim$22 × 106 m3 s−1. These results imply a prominent role for Antarctic sea ice in the upper branch and suggest that residual overturning and wind-driven sea-ice transport are tightly coupled.},

The heat fluxed southward by the deep overturning cell using the annual mean field for 1994 at 56S is 0.033 PW, but the 5-day mean fields give a larger heat flux (0.048 and 0.061 PW depending on calculation method).

As an application a mean flow with isopycnals having constant slope but arbitrary spacing is considered and the behavior of waves at turning points and critical layers is discussed. In particular, it is shown that horizontal variations of the mean flow shift the critical layer to the interior of the wave guide, i.e., away from $\omega$02 = f2, where $\omega$0 is the intrinsic frequency, and produces a valve effect at the critical layer which can be penetrated by a wave incident from one side while incidence from the other side results in absorption.},

abstract = {AbstractSimultaneous full-depth microstructure measurements of turbulence and finestructure measurements of velocity and density are analyzed to investigate the relationship between turbulence and the internal wave field in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. These data reveal a systematic near-bottom overprediction of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate by finescale parameterization methods in select locations. Sites of near-bottom overprediction are typically characterized by large near-bottom flow speeds and elevated topographic roughness. Further, lower-than-average shear-to-strain ratios indicative of a less near-inertial wave field, rotary spectra suggesting a predominance of upward internal wave energy propagation, and enhanced narrowband variance at vertical wavelengths on the order of 100 m are found at these locations. Finally, finescale overprediction is typically associated with elevated Froude numbers based on the near-bottom shear of the background flow, and a background flow with a systematic backing tendency. Agreement of microstructure- and finestructure-based estimates within the expected uncertainty of the parameterization away from these special sites, the reproducibility of the overprediction signal across various parameterization implementations, and an absence of indications of atypical instrument noise at sites of parameterization overprediction, all suggest that physics not encapsulated by the parameterization play a role in the fate of bottom-generated waves at these locations. Several plausible underpinning mechanisms based on the limited available evidence are discussed that offer guidance for future studies.},

abstract = {Recent estimates indicate that the Antarctic sea ice cover is expanding at a statistically significant rate with a magnitude one-third as large as the rapid rate of sea ice retreat in the Arctic. However, during the mid-2000s, with several fewer years in the observational record, the trend in Antarctic sea ice extent was reported to be considerably smaller and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Here, we show that much of the increase in the reported trend oc- curred due to the previously undocumented effect of a change in the way the satellite sea ice observations are processed for the widely used Bootstrap algorithm data set, rather than a physical increase in the rate of ice advance. Specifically, we find that a change in the intercalibration across a 1991 sensor transition when the data setwas reprocessed in 2007 caused a substantial change in the long-term trend. Although our anal- ysis does not definitively identify whether this change intro- duced an error or removed one, the resulting difference in the trends suggests that a substantial error exists in either the current data set or the version that was used prior to the mid- 2000s, and numerous studies that have relied on these ob- servations should be reexamined to determine the sensitivity of their results to this change in the data set. Furthermore, a number of recent studies have investigated physical mech- anisms for the observed expansion of the Antarctic sea ice cover. The results of this analysis raise the possibility that much of this expansion may be a spurious artifact of an error in the processing of the satellite observations.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation rates and internal wavefield characteristics is analyzed across two contrasting regimes of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), using microstructure and finestructure data collected as part of the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES). Mid-depth turbulent dissipation rates are found to increase from \nO(1×10−10Wkg −1) in the Southeast Pacific to \nO(1×10−9Wkg −1) in the Scotia Sea, typically reaching \n3×10−9Wkg −1 within a kilometer of the seabed. Enhanced levels of turbulent mixing are associated with strong near-bottom flows, rough topography, and regions where the internal wavefield is found to have enhanced energy, a less-inertial frequency content and a dominance of upward propagating energy. These results strongly suggest that bottom-generated internal waves play a major role in determining the spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation in the ACC. The energy flux associated with the bottom internal wave generation process is calculated using wave radiation theory, and found to vary between 0.8 mW m−2 in the Southeast Pacific and 14 mW m−2 in the Scotia Sea. Typically, 10%–30% of this energy is found to dissipate within 1 km of the seabed. Comparison between turbulent dissipation rates inferred from finestructure parameterizations and microstructure-derived estimates suggests a significant departure from wave-wave interaction physics in the near-field of wave generation sites.},

abstract = {The Southern Ocean plays a pivotal role in the global ocean circulation and climate1, 2, 3. There, the deep water masses of the world ocean upwell to the surface and subsequently sink to intermediate and abyssal depths, forming two overturning cells that exchange substantial quantities of heat and carbon with the atmosphere4, 5. The sensitivity of the upper cell to climatic changes in forcing is relatively well established6. However, little is known about how the lower cell responds, and in particular whether small-scale mixing in the abyssal Southern Ocean, an important controlling process of the lower cell7, 8, is influenced by atmospheric forcing. Here, we present observational evidence that relates changes in abyssal mixing to oceanic eddy variability on timescales of months to decades. Observational estimates of mixing rates, obtained along a repeat hydrographic transect across Drake Passage, are shown to be dependent on local oceanic eddy energy, derived from moored current meter and altimetric measurements. As the intensity of the regional eddy field is regulated by the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds9, 10, our findings suggest that Southern Ocean abyssal mixing and overturning are sensitive to climatic perturbations in wind forcing.},

abstract = {Much recent observational evidence suggests that energy from the barotropic tides can be used for mixing in the deep ocean. Here the process of internal-tide generation and dissipation by tidal flow over an isolated Gaussian topography is examined, using two-dimensional numerical simulations employing the MITgcm. Four different topographies are considered, for five different amplitudes of barotropic forcing, thereby allowing a variety of combinations of key nondimensional parameters. While much recent attention has focused on the role of relative topographic steepness and height in modifying the rate of conversion of energy from barotropic to baroclinic modes, here attention is focused on parameters dependent on the flow amplitude. For narrow topography, large amplitude forcing gives rise to baroclinic responses at higher harmonics of the forcing frequency. Tall narrow topographies are found to be the most conducive to mixing. Dissipation rates in these calculations are most efficient for the narrowest topography. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The estimate is based on a linear theory applied to bottom topography at O(1–10) km scales obtained from single beam echo soundings, to bottom stratification estimated from climatology, and to bottom velocity obtained from a global ocean model. The total energy flux into internal lee waves is estimated to be 0.2 TW which is 20% of the global wind power input into the ocean. The geographical distribution of the energy flux is largest in the Southern Ocean which accounts for half of the total energy flux. The results suggest that the generation of internal lee waves at rough topography is a significant energy sink for the geostrophic flows as well as an important energy source for internal waves and the associated turbulent mixing in the deep ocean.},

abstract = {The meridional overturning circulation of the ocean plays a central role in climate and climate variability by storing and transporting heat, fresh water and carbon around the globe. Historically, the focus of research has been on the North Atlantic Basin, a primary site where water sinks from the surface to depth, triggered by loss of heat, and therefore buoyancy, to the atmosphere. A key part of the overturning puzzle, however, is the return path from the interior ocean to the surface through upwelling in the Southern Ocean. This return path is largely driven by winds. It has become clear over the past few years that the importance of Southern Ocean upwelling for our understanding of climate rivals that of North Atlantic downwelling, because it controls the rate at which ocean reservoirs of heat and carbon communicate with the surface.},

@article{Meyer,
abstract = {A key remaining challenge in oceanography is the understanding and parameterization of small-scale mixing. Evidence suggests that topographic features play a significant role in enhancing mixing in the Southern Ocean. This study uses 914 high-resolution hydrographic profiles from novel EM-APEX profiling floats to investigate turbulent mixing north of the Kerguelen Plateau, a major topographic feature in the Southern Ocean. A shear–strain finescale parameterization is applied to estimate diapycnal diffusivity in the upper 1600 m of the ocean. The indirect estimates of mixing match direct microstructure profiler observations made simultaneously. It is found that mixing intensities have strong spatial and temporal variability, ranging from O(10 26) to O(10 23) m 2 s 21 . This study identifies topographic roughness, current speed, and wind speed as the main factors controlling mixing intensity. Additionally, the authors find strong regional variability in mixing dynamics and enhanced mixing in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current frontal region. This enhanced mixing is attributed to dissipating internal waves generated by the interaction of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the topography of the Kerguelen Plateau. Extending the mixing observations from the Kerguelen region to the entire Southern Ocean, this study infers a large water mass transformation rate of 17 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv [ 10 6 m 3 s 21) across the boundary of Antarctic Intermediate Water and Upper Circumpolar Deep Water in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This work suggests that the contribution of mixing to the Southern Ocean overturning circulation budget is particularly significant in fronts.},

abstract = {Oceanic density overturns are commonly used to parameterize the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy. This method assumes a linear scaling between the Thorpe length scale L T and the Ozmidov length scale L O . Historic evidence supporting L T ; L O has been shown for relatively weak shear-driven turbulence of the thermocline; however, little support for the method exists in regions of turbulence driven by the convective collapse of topographically influenced overturns that are large by open-ocean standards. This study presents a direct comparison of L T and L O , using vertical profiles of temperature and microstructure shear collected in the Luzon Strait—a site characterized by topographically influenced overturns up to O(100) m in scale. The comparison is also done for open-ocean sites in the Brazil basin and North Atlantic where overturns are generally smaller and due to different processes. A key result is that L T /L O increases with overturn size in a fashion similar to that observed in numerical studies of Kelvin–Helmholtz (K–H) in-stabilities for all sites but is most clear in data from the Luzon Strait. Resultant bias in parameterized dissi-pation is mitigated by ensemble averaging; however, a positive bias appears when instantaneous observations are depth and time integrated. For a series of profiles taken during a spring tidal period in the Luzon Strait, the integrated value is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that based on the microstructure observations. Physical arguments supporting L T ; L O are revisited, and conceptual regimes explaining the relationship between L T /L O and a nondimensional overturn size c L T are proposed. In a companion paper, Scotti obtains similar conclusions from energetics arguments and simulations.},

abstract = {This bi-polar analysis resolves ice edge changes on space/time scales relevant for investigating seasonal ice-ocean feedbacks and focuses on spatio-temporal changes in the timing of annual sea ice retreat and advance over 1979/80 to 2010/11. Where Arctic sea ice decrease is fastest, the sea ice retreat is now nearly 2 months earlier and subsequent advance more than 1 month later (compared to 1979/80), resulting in a 3-month longer summer ice-free season. In the Antarctic Peninsula and Bellingshausen Sea region, sea ice retreat is more than 1 month earlier and advance 2 months later, resulting in a more than 3-month longer summer ice-free season. In contrast, in the western Ross Sea (Antarctica) region, sea ice retreat and advance are more than 1 month later and earlier respectively, resulting in a more than 2 month shorter summer ice-free season. Regardless of trend magnitude or direction, and at latitudes mostly poleward of 70° (N/S), there is strong correspondence between anomalies in the timings of sea ice retreat and subsequent advance, but little correspondence between advance and subsequent retreat. These results support a strong ocean thermal feedback in autumn in response to changes in spring sea ice retreat. Further, model calculations suggest different net ocean heat changes in the Arctic versus Antarctic where autumn sea ice advance is 1 versus 2 months later. Ocean-atmosphere changes, particularly in boreal spring and austral autumn (i.e., during ∼March-May), are discussed and compared, as well as possible inter-hemispheric climate connections.},

Problems arise in calculation of water fluxes because of uncertainties in (a) values of off-axis fluxes and (b) the partition of axial heat flow between high-temperature black smoker and lower-temperature diffuse flow. Of the various geochemical methods of estimating fluxes, 3 He/heat data are extremely variable, the Mg method is sensitive to flank fluxes, Sr isotopes agree with geophysical estimates only if flank fluxes are important, Li isotopes data are consistent with geophysical values, and Ge/Si ratios give low fluxes, which may reflect low-temperature processes not yet fully quantified. Estimates of hydrothermal heat and water fluxes derived from these approaches are presented as are hydrothermal chemical fluxes at the ridge axis, off axis, and as affected by hydrothermal plumes.},

The largest increase has been in autumn when there has been a dipole of significant positive and negative trends in the Ross and Amundsen&#8208;Bellingshausen Seas respectively. The autumn increase in the Ross Sea sector is primarily a result of stronger cyclonic atmospheric flow over the Amundsen Sea. Model experiments suggest that the trend towards stronger cyclonic circulation is mainly a result of stratospheric ozone depletion, which has strengthened autumn wind speeds around the continent, deepening the Amundsen Sea Low through flow separation around the high coastal orography. However, statistics derived from a climate model control run suggest that the observed sea ice increase might still be within the range of natural climate variability.},

We investigate the impact of this new information on high-end global sea level rise projections by developing a probabilistic process-based method. It is shown that uncertainties in the projections increase when including the temperature dependence of Antarctic mass loss and the uncertainty in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model ensemble. Including these new uncertainties we provide probability density functions for the high-end distribution of total global mean sea level in 2100 conditional on emission scenario.

The sensitivity of the energy flux into lee waves from preindustrial, present, and possible future climate conditions is explored in this study using linear theory. The bottom stratification and geostrophic velocity fields needed for the calculation of the energy flux into lee waves are provided by Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's global coupled ocean–ice–atmosphere model, CM2G. The unresolved mesoscale eddy energy is parameterized as a function of the large-scale available potential energy. Simulations using historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios were performed over the 1861–2200 period. The diagnostics herein suggest a decrease of the global energy flux into lee waves on the order of 20% from preindustrial to future climate conditions under the RCP8.5 scenario. In the Southern Ocean, the energy flux into lee waves exhibits a clear annual cycle with maximum values in austral winter. The long-term decrease of the global energy flux into lee waves and the annual cycle of the energy flux in the Southern Ocean are mostly due to changes in bottom velocity.},

abstract = {Abstract A simple theoretical model of the deep stratification and meridional overturning circulation in an idealized single-basin ocean with a circumpolar channel is presented. The theory includes the effects of wind, eddies, and diapycnal mixing; predicts the deep stratification in terms of the surface forcing and other problem parameters; makes no assumption of zero residual circulation; and consistently accounts for the interaction between the circumpolar channel and the rest of the ocean. The theory shows that dynamics of the overturning circulation can be characterized by two limiting regimes, corresponding to weak and strong diapycnal mixing. The transition between the two regimes is described by a nondimensional number characterizing the strength of the diffusion-driven compared to the wind-driven overturning circulation. In the limit of weak diapycnal mixing, deep stratification throughout the ocean is produced by the effects of wind and eddies in a circumpolar channel and maintained even in the ...},

The long-term and short-term behavior of the polynya margin and the regional ice concentration are interpreted in light of several oceanographic and meteorological theories explaining the circulation relevant to its origin, stability and role.

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distributions of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) are investigated, using monthly data from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis for the period 1980-2004. Patterns of atmospheric forcing are identified in observations of sea level pressure and air-sea heat fluxes. It is found that a significant fraction of SST variability in the ACC can be understood as a linear response to surface forcing by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and remote forcing by ENSO. The physical mechanisms rely on the interplay between atmospheric variability and mean advection by the ACC. SAM and ENSO drive a low-level anomalous circulation pattern localized over the South Pacific Ocean, inducing surface heat fluxes and Ekman heat advection anomalies. A simple model of SST propagating in the ACC, forced with heat fluxes estimated from the reanalysis, suggests that surface heat fluxes and Ekman heat advection are equally important in driving the observed SST variability. Further diagnostics indicate that SST anomalies, generated mainly upstream of Drake Passage, are subsequently advected by the ACC and damped after a couple of years. It is suggested that SST variability along the path of the ACC is largely a passive response of the oceanic mixed layer to atmospheric forcing.},

The impact of this ozone recovery on SH climate is investigated using 21st century simulations with a chemistry climate model (CCM). The model response to the ozone recovery by 2100 shows that tropospheric circulation changes during austral summer caused by ozone depletion between 1970 and 2000 almost reverse, despite increasing GHG concentrations. Comparison of the CCM results with multi-model scenario experiments from the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasize the importance of stratospheric ozone recovery for Antarctic climate.},

abstract = {Analysis of topography and new swath bathymetry as well as geophysical data provides information about aerial and submarine morphological features and mass transfer processes on Montserrat. The island has a characteristic shallow (<100 m) submarine shelf, interpreted as having been formed through erosion with a depth controlled by glacio-eustatic sea-level variation. Several debris avalanche deposits are identified on the lower submarine flanks of Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcano, and there is evidence of lateral collapses at the older volcanic centres. The morphological evolution of Montserrat is interpreted in terms of three stages. The first stage comprises submarine growth. The second stage, subaerial growth, is represented by the active South Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills-Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcanic centre. During the current eruption of Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcano (1995-2002) more than half of the lava erupted was transported into the sea. Flank collapses occurred several times during this stage, such as the English's Crater event (c. 4000 years ago) or the Boxing Day event during the current eruption (26 December 1997). Montserrat's older volcanic centres, the Centre Hills and Silver Hills, illustrate the third stage of evolution, extinction and erosion. Magma production, long-term erosion and total sedimentation rates on Montserrat have been estimated as 0.17 km3 ka-1, 0.0125 km3 ka-1 and 0.11 km3 ka-1 (i.e. 1.1 cm ka-1), respectively.},

abstract = {As the world's ice diminishes in the face of climate change—from the dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice, to thinning at the margins of both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, to retreating mountain glaciers the world over—Antarctic sea ice presents something of a paradox. Te trend in total sea ice extent in the Antarctic has remained steady, or even increased slightly, over the past three decades, confounding climate model predictions showing moderate to strong declines. Tis apparent intransigence masks dramatic regional trends; declines in sea ice in the Bellingshausen Sea region that rival the high-profile decline in the Arctic have been matched by opposing increases in the Ross Sea. Much of the explanation lies in the unique nature of the Antarctic sea ice zone. Its position surrounding the continent and exposure to the high-energy wind and wave fields of the open Southern Ocean shape both its properties and its connection to the atmosphere and ocean in ways very different from the Arctic. Sea ice extent and variability are strongly driven by large-scale climate variability patterns such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode. Because many of these patterns have opposing effects in different regions around the continent, decreases in one region are oſten accompanied by similar, opposing increases in another. Yet, the failure of climate models to capture either the overall or regional behavior also reflects, in part, a poor understanding of sea ice processes. Considerable insight has been gained into the nature of these processes over the past several decades through field expeditions aboard icebreakers. However, much remains to be discovered about the nature of Antarctic sea ice; its connections with the ocean, atmosphere, and ecosystem; and its complex response to present and future climate change.},

abstract = {This study investigates the influence of high-latitude climate variability on the Antarctic sea ice distribution. The climate variability examined here includes distinct climate modes, such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), quasi-stationary wave-3 pattern, Pacific South American pattern (PSA) and Semi-Annual Oscillation (SAO). The results reveal that the largest impact comes from PSA in the Antarctic Dipole (ADP) region of the western hemisphere at the interannual timescale, which is related to the teleconnection of El Ni?o&#8722;Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The wave-3 pattern also has a strong and similar influence on sea ice in the ADP regions as PSA does, suggesting a positive interaction between PSA and wave-3 in the region. Measured by correlation coefficients and their significance, SAM has a relatively less significant influence on sea ice than other climate patterns in general, though this global assessment may not apply to particular regions. Sea ice usually responds to large-scale atmospheric anomalies with a 2-month delay. The singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis reveals that the coupled relationships between sea ice and atmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind fields are represented by these known climate modes. The leading coupled modes between sea ice and sea level pressure are accountable for 50% to 60% of total squared covariance for all seasons. The leading modes between sea ice and surface air temperature in winter and summer are also accountable for the same amount of total squared covariance. It indicates that these well-established climate modes/patterns are the dominant factors leading to a strong interaction between the atmosphere and sea ice field in the Antarctic.},

A continuation of this intensification trend is projected by climate scenarios for the twenty-first century. The response of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean to changes in wind stress and surface buoyancy fluxes is under debate. Here we analyse the Argo network of profiling floats and historical oceanographic data to detect coherent hemispheric-scale warming and freshening trends that extend to depths of more than 1,000 m. The warming and freshening is partly related to changes in the properties of the water masses that make up the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which are consistent with the anthropogenic changes in heat and freshwater fluxes suggested by climate models. However, we detect no increase in the tilt of the surfaces of equal density across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, in contrast to coarse-resolution model studies. Our results imply that the transport in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and meridional overturning in the Southern Ocean are insensitive to decadal changes in wind stress.},

However, climate models have failed to reproduce the overall increase in sea ice11. Here we present a data set of satellite-tracked sea-ice motion for the period of 1992–2010 that reveals large and statistically significant trends in Antarctic ice drift, which, in most sectors, can be linked to local winds. We quantify dynamic and thermodynamic processes in the internal ice pack and show that wind-driven changes in ice advection are the dominant driver of ice-concentration trends around much of West Antarctica, whereas wind-driven thermodynamic changes dominate elsewhere. The ice-drift trends also imply large changes in the surface stress that drives the Antarctic ocean gyres, and in the fluxes of heat and salt responsible for the production of Antarctic bottom and intermediate waters.},

abstract = {Diapycnal mixing plays a key role in maintaining the ocean stratification and the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). In the ocean interior, it is mainly sustained by breaking internal waves. Two important classes of internal waves are internal tides and lee waves, generated by barotropic tides and geostrophic flows interacting with rough topography, respectively. Currently, regarding internal wave–driven mixing, most climate models only explicitly parameterize the local dissipation of internal tides. In this study, the authors explore the combined effects of internal tide– and lee wave–driven mixing on the ocean state. A series of sensitivity experiments using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory CM2G ocean–ice–atmosphere coupled model are performed, including a parameterization of lee wave–driven mixing using a recent estimate for the global map of energy conversion into lee waves, in addition to the tidal mixing parameterization. It is shown that, although the global energy input in the deep ocean into lee waves (0.2 TW; where 1 TW = 10^12 W) is small compared to that into internal tides (1.4 TW), lee wave–driven mixing makes a significant impact on the ocean state, notably on the ocean thermal structure and stratification, as well as on the MOC. The vertically integrated circulation is also impacted in the Southern Ocean, which accounts for half of the lee wave energy flux. Finally, it is shown that the different spatial distribution of the internal tide and lee wave energy input impacts the sensitivity described in this study. These results suggest that lee wave–driven mixing should be parameterized in climate models, preferably using more physically based parameterizations that allow the internal lee wave–driven mixing to evolve in a changing ocean.},

abstract = {<p>Recent studies have investigated the potential link between the freshwater input derived from the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet and the observed recent increase in sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean. In this study, we assess the impact of an additional freshwater flux on the trend in sea ice extent and concentration in a simulation with data assimilation, spanning the period 1850–2009, as well as in retrospective forecasts (hindcasts) initialised in 1980. In a simulation with data assimilation, including an additional freshwater flux that follows an autoregressive process improves the reconstruction of the trend in ice extent and concentration between 1980 and 2009. This is partly due to a better representation of the freshwater cycle in the Southern Ocean, but the additional flux could also compensate for some model deficiencies. In addition, it modifies the simulated mean state of the sea ice. A hindcast initialised from this shifted state has to be forced by an additional freshwater flux with an amplitude similar to the one included in the simulation with data assimilation in order to avoid a model drift. This points out the importance of the experimental design that has to be consistent between the simulation used to compute the initial state and the hindcast initialised from this initial state. The hindcast including this constant additional freshwater flux provides trends in sea ice extent and concentration that are in satisfying agreement with satellite observations. This thus constitutes encouraging results for sea ice predictions in the Southern Ocean. In our simulation, the positive trend in ice extent over the last 30 years is largely determined by the state of the system in the late 1970's. No increase in meltwater flux from Antarctica is required.</p>},

abstract = {Abstract The oceanic response to imposed changes in the latitude of the subpolar westerly winds (SWWs) over the Southern Ocean is assessed in a global ocean model. The latitude changes are achieved by applying a zonally uniform zonal wind stress anomaly that is quasi-sinusoidal in latitude, with a positive (negative) band to the south (north) of about 50°S. This form of anomaly is chosen because it projects onto the Antarctic Oscillation, also known as the Southern Hemisphere annular mode, that is known to have a long-term trend. The response to both long-term trend and quasi-decadal periodic changes is examined in the latitude of the SWWs. In the long-term trend case, a 5.4° poleward shift of the SWWs over a 100-yr simulation is found to cause the poleward heat transport to increase by an average of 25% between 50°S and the equator. This change is primarily due to greater northward Ekman transport of cold water and its associated cooling of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) by up to 0.5°C in the central-sou...},

abstract = {We use a high-resolution seawater Sr isotopic evolution curve for the last 100 m.y. in conjunction with modern riverine Sr flux measurements, and also geologic, tectonic and geochronological data, to make the case for a close relationship between seawater Sr isotopic composition and the India-Asia continental collision. Using a simple seawater Sr budget model we begin by showing that the Sr flux associated with alteration of seafloor basalts is too small and does not have the right time evolution to account for much of the seawater Sr isotopic curve of the last 100 m.y. The flux of dissolved Sr carried by rivers originating in the Himalaya-Tibet region on the other hand is presently a significant fraction of the global Sr budget. We calculate how this riverine flux would have had to change with time in order to match the observed seawater Sr isotopic curve and find that the riverine flux remains relatively constant prior to the collision of India with Asia but then increases very significantly after collision. We note that the period of most rapid change in seawater Sr isotopic ratio, from 20 Ma to 15 Ma, is also a period of exceptionally high erosion in parts of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. As further evidence that Sr derived from the collision of India with Asia plays a major role in the Sr isotopic evolution of seawater we show that the total amount erosion of the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau since collision, which we calculate separately, represents a total amount of Sr that is very nearly the same as the cumulative amount required by the Sr isotopic change of seawater since collision. The relationship between erosion and riverine Sr flux allows us to use the Sr isotopic evolution of seawater to reconstruct a history of erosion since collision, and we find that the erosion rate accelerates with time since collision, with the present having the largest rate. When we apply the Sr budget model to the entire Phanerozoic using a new compilation of deformed continental area versus time we find that we can account for the large-scale structure of the seawater Sr isotopic curve, but fail to reproduce several local maxima and minima, especially in the period 100-300 Ma. The present high 87Sr86Sr of seawater and similar highs in the Devonian and Cambrian do correlate with extensive deformation on the continents. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Observations show that, in contrast to the Arctic, the area of Antarctic sea ice has increased since 1979. A potential driver of this significant increase relates to the mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet. Subsurface ocean warming causes basal ice-shelf melt, freshening the surface waters around Antarctica, which leads to increases in sea-ice cover. With climate warming ongoing, future mass-loss rates are projected to accelerate, which has the potential to affect future Antarctic sea-ice trends. Here we investigate to what extent future sea-ice trends are influenced by projected increases in Antarctic freshwater flux due to subsurface melt, using a state-of-the-art global climate model (EC-Earth) in standardized Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) climate-change simulations. Virtually all CMIP5 models disregard ocean-ice-sheet interactions and project strongly retreating Antarctic sea ice. Applying various freshwater flux scenarios, we find that the additional fresh water significantly offsets the decline in sea-ice area and is even able to reverse the trend in the strongest freshwater forcing scenario that can reasonably be expected, especially in austral winter. The model also simulates decreasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with the SST trends exhibiting strong regional variations that largely correspond to regional sea-ice trends.},

abstract = {During July-September 1998 a comprehensive survey was undertaken of the Celtic Sea and St. George's Channel of the Irish Sea in order to resolve the three-dimensional density field and circulation. Towed undulating CTD data revealed that isolated below the seasonal thermocline was a dense (cold and saline) pool flanked by strong near-bed density gradients. The trajectories of 23 satellite-tracked Argos drifters demonstrated the existence of a cyclonic (anti-clockwise) circulation pattern. This was in accord with persistent and narrow (ca. 20 km) cores of cyclonic flow (dense water to the left) as revealed by geostrophic current estimates and moored acoustic Doppler current profiler data, with velocities >0.1 ms-1 and exceeding 0.3 ms-1 in St. George's Channel. The results are consistent with a seasonal baroclinic circulation that advects saline Atlantic water through the south and west of the region to St. George's Channel. Westward flow across St. George's Channel is directed south into the Celtic Sea and west along the Irish coast. The southward flow, an artefact of the baroclinic circulation, often appears in infrared satellite imagery as a meander in the Celtic Sea front. At the southward extension a secondary clockwise circulation is formed (diameter ??? 40 km) before water joins westward flow. Fresher water of coastal origin, present in the northern Celtic Sea in late spring, is advected westward by the summer circulation. The advent of summer thermal stratification and associated flow fields reduces exchange between the Celtic and Irish Seas. The understanding provided by such datasets such as those described here provides the necessary basis for environmental management and knowledge of the pathways for contaminants, the dynamics of nutrients and an understanding of the movement of larvae and juvenile fish. It also provides a template against which to test the prognostic capabilities of present and emerging baroclinic numerical models. Crown Copyright ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The response of the sea ice in the Southern Ocean to the variability of the atmosphere on the period 1979–2004 is investigated using both model and observational data. On the one hand, our results show that in line with previous investigations, the classical modes of atmospheric variability do not explain a large part of the winter sea ice extent variability integrated over the entire Southern Ocean. On the other hand, the regression between the ice extent and the atmospheric pressure displays a pattern with low pressure areas over the South Atlantic, over the Indian Ocean, and on the southwestern part of the Pacific Ocean and a high pressure area over the Antarctic region extending toward both the southeastern Pacific and the region south of Australia. This pattern, which does not correlate significantly with any of the known modes of atmospheric variability, induces changes in the sea ice extent by influencing the air temperature, the ice production, and both the meridional and the zonal ice velocity. However, there is no clear link between the different centers of action of this pattern. Furthermore, the correlation of the sea ice extent between the different sectors is generally low. As a conclusion, we must consider that the sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean over the last 30 years does not behave as a single entity: Its variability is the result of the combination of regional sea ice changes. Each sector should thus be examined separately.},

abstract = {The rate of generation of internal gravity waves in the lee of small length scale topography by geostrophic flow in the World Ocean was estimated using linear theory with corrections for finite amplitude topography. Several global data sets were combined for the calculation including an ocean circulation model for the near-bottom geostrophic flow statistics, over 500 abyssal current meter records, historical climatological data for the buoyancy frequency, and two independent estimates of the small scale topographic statistical properties. The first topography estimate was based on an empirically-derived relationship between paleo-spreading rates and abyssal hill roughness, with corrections for sedimentation. The second estimate was based on small-scale (<100 km) roughness of satellite altimetry-derived gravity field, using upward continuation relationships to derive estimates of abyssal hill roughness at the seafloor at scales less than approximately 20 km. The lee wave generation rate was found to be between 0.34 to 0.49 TW. The Southern Hemisphere produced 92% of the lee wave energy, with the Southern Ocean dominating. Strength of the bottom flow was the most important factor in producing the global pattern of generation rate, except in the Indian Ocean where extremely rough topography produced strong lee wave generation despite only moderate bottom flows. The results imply about one half of the mechanical power input to the ocean general circulation from the extra-equatorial wind stress of the World Ocean results from abyssal lee wave generation. Topographic length scales between 176 m and 2.5 km (horizontal wavelengths between 1 and 16 km) accounted for 90% of the globally integrated generation.},

abstract = {Recent estimates from observations and inverse models indicate that turbulent mixing associated with internal wave breaking is enhanced above rough topography in the Southern Ocean. In most regions of the ocean, abyssal mixing has been primarily associated with radiation and breaking of internal tides. In this study, it is shown that abyssal mixing in the Southern Ocean can be sustained by internal waves generated by geostrophic motions that dominate abyssal flows in this region. Theory and fully nonlinear numerical simu-lations are used to estimate the internal wave radiation and dissipation from lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler (LADCP), CTD, and topography data from two regions in the Southern Ocean: Drake Passage and the southeast Pacific. The results show that radiation and dissipation of internal waves generated by geostrophic motions reproduce the magnitude and distribution of dissipation previously inferred from finescale mea-surements in the region, suggesting that it is one of the primary drivers of abyssal mixing in the Southern Ocean.},

abstract = {This contribution describes two mass movement deposits (total volume $\sim$0.5km3) identified in seven marine cores located 8 to 15km offshore southern Montserrat, West Indies. The deposits were emplaced in the last 35ka and have not previously been recognised in either the subaerial or distal submarine records. Age constraints, provided by radiocarbon dating, show that an explosive volcanic eruption occurred at ca 8-12ka, emplacing a primary eruption-related deposit that overlies a large ($\sim$0.3km3) reworked bioclastic and volcaniclastic flow deposit, formed from a shelf collapse between 8 and 35ka. The origin of these deposits has been deduced through the correlation of marine sediment cores, component analysis and geochemical analysis. The 8-12ka primary volcanic deposit was likely derived from a highly-erosive pyroclastic flow from the Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcano that entered the ocean and mixed with the water column forming a water-supported density current. Previous investigations of the eruption record suggested that there was a hiatus in activity at the Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcano between 16 and 6ka. The ca 8-12ka eruptive episode identified here shows that this hiatus was shorter than previously hypothesised, and thus highlights the importance of obtaining an accurate and complete marine record of events offshore from volcanic islands and incorporating such data into eruption history reconstructions. Comparisons with the submarine deposit characteristics of the 2003 dome collapse also suggests that the $\sim$8-12ka eruptive episode was more explosive than eruptions from the current eruptive episode. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

A rough upper bound on the net momentum flux into the mesosphere due to a large ensemble of mutually incoherent KH-generated clear-air turbulence events is then estimated, using reasonable-looking assumptions about the statistics of such events.

abstract = {<p>Recent studies have investigated the potential link between the freshwater input derived from the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet and the observed recent increase in sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean. In this study, we assess the impact of an additional freshwater flux on the trend in sea ice extent and concentration in a simulation with data assimilation, spanning the period 1850–2009, as well as in retrospective forecasts (hindcasts) initialised in 1980. In a simulation with data assimilation, including an additional freshwater flux that follows an autoregressive process improves the reconstruction of the trend in ice extent and concentration between 1980 and 2009. This is partly due to a better representation of the freshwater cycle in the Southern Ocean, but the additional flux could also compensate for some model deficiencies. In addition, it modifies the simulated mean state of the sea ice. A hindcast initialised from this shifted state has to be forced by an additional freshwater flux with an amplitude similar to the one included in the simulation with data assimilation in order to avoid a model drift. This points out the importance of the experimental design that has to be consistent between the simulation used to compute the initial state and the hindcast initialised from this initial state. The hindcast including this constant additional freshwater flux provides trends in sea ice extent and concentration that are in satisfying agreement with satellite observations. This thus constitutes encouraging results for sea ice predictions in the Southern Ocean. In our simulation, the positive trend in ice extent over the last 30 years is largely determined by the state of the system in the late 1970's. No increase in meltwater flux from Antarctica is required.</p>},

Around 2–3 years earlier (1998), the circumpolar eastward wind stress (as quantified by the Southern Annular Mode; SAM) showed a significant positive peak, and we have shown previously that the ACC peaked around 1998 in response. An eddy-resolving ocean model is used to investigate the delay between wind forcing and the eddy response, and demonstrates that the lag is due to the time taken to influence the deep circulation of the ACC. Winds over the Southern Ocean have shown a strong climatic increase over the past few decades. If this increase in winds is also reflected as an increase in eddy activity (as our analysis suggests it might), then the increased poleward heat flux may have played a significant role in the observed warming of the Southern Ocean.},

abstract = {An objective measure of the length scale of turbulent overturning events, the Thorpe scale, Lr, is compared to the Ozmidov scale Lo = (e/N3) 1/2, where N is the buoyancy frequency and e is the kinetic energy dissipation rate. Far from the surface in wind-forced mixing layers and in the seasonal thermocline, Lo and Lr are of the same order, but near the surface of a mixing layer, Lo is significantly larger than Lr. The change in the ratio Lo/Lr is attributed to a decrease in the gradient Richardson number in the highly energetic zone near the surface. Another length scale, LB = (DCx/N) /2, where Cx is the Cox number and D is the molecular diffusivity of temperature, is the same order as Lr near the surface of a mixing layer as well as in the layer interior and in the seasonal thermocline. It is shown, by using the turbulent kinetic energy budget, that LB/Lr is only weakly dependent on the gradient Richardson number as long as the ratio of eddy viscosity to eddy diffusivity is constant. The temperature variance dissipation rate is compared to the product of the buoyancy frequency and the existing temperature variance. Temperature fluctuations are defined as the temperature difference between the observed temperature profile and the Thorpe profile (the temperature profile which would result if an overturning patch gravitationally collapsed without dissipation). It is shown that the major balance in the temperature variance equation is between the rate at which variance is produced and the rate at which it is dissipated and that the rate of change of temperature variance can be an important modification to this balance only if the variance decays in a time much smaller than a buoyancy period.},

abstract = {This document outlines how the thermodynamic properties of seawater are evaluated using the International Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater – 2010 (TEOS-10). This thermodynamic description of seawater is based on a Gibbs function formulation from which thermodynamic properties such as entropy, specific volume, enthalpy and potential enthalpy are calculated directly. When determined from the Gibbs function, these quantities are fully consistent with each other. Entropy and enthalpy are required for an accurate description of the advection and diffusion of heat in the ocean interior and for quantifying the ocean's role in exchanging heat with the atmosphere and with ice. The Gibbs function is a function of Absolute Salinity, temperature and pressure. In contrast to Practical Salinity, Absolute Salinity is expressed in SI units and it includes the influence of the small spatial variations of seawater composition in the global ocean. Absolute Salinity is the appropriate salinity variable for the accurate calculation of horizontal density gradients in the ocean. Absolute Salinity is also the appropriate salinity variable for the calculation of freshwater fluxes and for calculations involving the exchange of freshwater with the atmosphere and with ice. Potential functions are included for ice and for moist air, leading to accurate expressions for numerous thermodynamic properties of ice and air including freezing temperature and latent heats of melting and of evaporation. This TEOS-10 Manual describes how the thermodynamic properties of seawater, ice and moist air are used in order to accurately represent the transport of heat in the ocean and the exchange of heat with the atmosphere and with ice.},

@article{Durran2003,
abstract = {Buoyancy perturbations develop when stably stratified air ascends a mountain barrier. These perturbations often trigger disturbances that propagate away from the mountain as gravity (or buoyancy) waves. Gravity waves triggered by the flow over a mountain are referred to as mountain waves or lee waves. Mountain waves sometimes reveal their presence through dramatic cloud formations, such as smooth lenticular clouds (see Figs. 4 and 5) and ragged rotor clouds. Large-amplitude mountain waves can generate regions of clear-air-turbulence that pose a hazard to aviation. Large-amplitude mountain waves may also produce very strong winds that blow down the lee slope of ridge-like topographic barriers (see downslope winds). What happens to mountain waves after they are generated? If the wave amplitude becomes large in comparison to the vertical wavelength, the streamlines in a vertically propagating mountain wave steepen and overturn in a manner roughly analogous to a breaking wave in the ocean. Such “convective” overturning often occurs as the waves enter the lower stratosphere where they encounter increased static stability and de- creasing horizontal wind speeds. The convective overturning of vertically propagating waves is also promoted by the systematic decrease in atmospheric density with height. Those waves that do not breakdown due to convective overturning before reaching the mesosphere are ultimately dissipated by the vertical transfer of infra red radiation be- tween the warm and cool regions within the wave and the surrounding atmosphere (“radiative damping”). Horizontal momentum is transported by mountain waves from the regions of wave dissipation to the surface where a net pressure force is exerted on the topography. A decelerative force is exerted on the large-scale atmospheric circulation in those regions where the wave undergoes dissipation. The basic structure of a mountain wave is determined by the size and shape of the mountain and by the vertical profiles of temperature, wind speed and moisture in the impinging flow. The overall character of the wave can often be predicted on the basis of linear theory, in which the mountain is assumed to be small in comparison with the vertical wavelength of the mountain wave, and such theory will be the subject of the next section. Nevertheless, nonlinear effects do exert an significant influence on the wave amplitude and are essential to the dynamics of mountain-wave dissipation in regions of wave-breaking; such effects will be considered later in this article.},

abstract = {Turbulent microstructure and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data were collected near Tacoma Narrows in Puget Sound, Washington. Over 100 coincident microstructure profiles have been compared to ADCP estimates of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate (). ADCP dissipation rates were calculated using the large-eddy method with theoretically determined corrections for sensor noise on rms velocity and integral-scale calculations. This work is an extension of Ann Gargett's approach, which used a narrowband ADCP in regions with intense turbulence and strong vertical velocities. Here, a broadband ADCP is used to measure weaker turbulence and achieve greater horizontal and vertical resolution relative to the narrowband ADCP. Estimates of from the Modular Microstructure Profiler (MMP) and broadband ADCP show good quantitative agreement over nearly three decades of dissipation rate, 3 3 10 28 –10 25 m 2 s 23 . This technique is most readily applied when the turbulent velocity is greater than the ADCP velocity uncertainty (s) and the ADCP cell size is within a factor of 2 of the Thorpe scale. The 600-kHz broadband ADCP used in this experiment yielded a noise floor of 3 mm s 21 for 3-m vertical bins and 2-m along-track average ('four pings), which resulted in turbulence levels measureable with the ADCP as weak as 3 3 10 28 m 2 s 23 . The value and trade-off of changing the ADCP cell size, which reduces noise but also changes the ratio of the Thorpe scale to the cell size, are discussed as well.},

The circumpolar volume transport is relatively insensitive to surface wind forcing in models that resolve turbulent ocean eddies, a process termed " eddy saturation. " Here a simple model is presented that explains the physics of eddy saturation with three ingredients: a momentum budget, a relation between the eddy form stress and eddy energy, and an eddy energy budget. The model explains both the insensitivity of circumpolar volume transport to surface wind stress and the increase of eddy energy with wind stress. The model further predicts that circumpolar transport increases with increased bottom friction, a counterintuitive result that is confirmed in eddy-permitting calculations. These results suggest an unexpected and important impact of eddy energy dissipation, through bottom drag or lee wave generation, on ocean stratification, ocean heat content, and potentially atmospheric CO 2 .},

In contrast to a previous study, our simulations show that the freshwater effect on sea ice trends over the historical period is small and fails to reproduce the observed regional pattern of trends, when using observationally consistent rates of freshwater forcing. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models do not represent this dynamic ice sheet mass loss, and it has been suggested that this deficiency may significantly influence the simulated sea ice trends.
